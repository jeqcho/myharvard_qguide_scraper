Weekly psets that are pretty easy, especially if you go work on it at office hours or help room with the CAs. Great to take if you are studying for the MCAT.

I was pretty nervous heading into it because I had  no physics background from high school, but the course staff does an AMAZING job at making sure you gain the foundational skills and knowledge to succeed in the course. PS2 is one of those courses that you will find yourself spending some time on, but that the time you put in to the course actually pays off in the end. You are given every resource needed to succeed.</td>

The workload is meh, 1 regular PSET and 1 online question set. The exam prep material is not that helpful. The flipped classroom style is not great because there is not a lot of material that actually teaches you beforehand. The lectures you basically just do questions but they run out of time to explain them so they are not helpful. If you take this class, spend time every week doing practice problems. It was not terrible but the exams kinda suck. The teaching staff wants you to do well so they do help a lot with grading, extra credit, and extra points, they do not want people doing poorly. You do have to work pretty hard for a good grade but it is possible kinda. Sometimes I felt no matter how much you studied for an exam it did not matter because sometimes they ask the most random questions that are unlike anything else we have seen</td>

I heard the content was overly complicated and the course was disorganized. However I actually think it was a good course overall. There is a lot of work, especially with 2 psets a week and lab every 2 weeks but it is totally manageable. The two things I didn&#x27;t like were the lectures (they were almost completely useless) and the lab (also kind of useless). Otherwise, everything was smooth and you had the resources to do well. Lots of office hours are available, the course heads were really approachable and understanding, and most importantly the exams were doable as long as you did a lot of practice.</td>

There is so much help available to do well in the course, I was never worried about my performance. Section is very helpful and the Achieve homework is a great low&ndash;stakes way of practicing problem&ndash;solving and really making sure you get all the concepts down. The course forces you to stay up&ndash;to&ndash;date for the homeworks and section which I deeply appreciated. There are also lots of office house and the staff is really helpful and approachable and accommodating. There is however a good amount of work to be done for the course (section, the 2 homeworks, lab report, pre&ndash;lab and post&ndash;lab surveys, the pre&ndash;lecture activities, etc.) so make sure you account for that coming in. You will learn a lot but make sure you do the things every week and stay up&ndash;to&ndash;date, it can be easy to fall behind (not because the things are hard but because there&#x27;s so many of them and it can be easy to forget). Still GREAT course, highly recommend for your physics requirement if you are a life scientist.</td>

			<td class="TabularBody_LeftColumn" headers="comment-2_42d8ade9-f806-4555-b28b-e906686a3a5c">The professors in this course are extremely well&ndash;intentioned, but PS2 is in need of some serious reform in order to be a good physics class. First, the positives: the course staff is, overall, very kind and good&ndash;natured. Steve and Greg both responded to emails very quickly and clearly wanted students to do well. This is, fortunately, not one of those pre&ndash;med classes where the professors revel in it being students&#x27; worst nightmare. Additionally, they did their best to accommodate the varying preferences of students. For the midterms, you take the exam once and then do it again in a group. The professors gave the option to do the group exam in person or at home. Additionally, since the final was on December 20, they offered the option to take it from home, which I was very thankful for. Additionally, the midterms and final are representative of the course material and there are no real surprises. This said, the course has a lot of drawbacks. First, the pacing is terrible &ndash; both professors struggled to cover all of the material in class (it would consistently take 40 minutes to make it through the first page of notes), meaning we often didn&#x27;t cover important material in class. The professors try to include a lot of demonstrations, but this often takes out time from the needed content. Overall, I think it would be possible to shorten some of the activities and still get through all of the content. It was obvious that students started to get really bored in those first 40 minutes (because things weren&#x27;t moving very quickly), which I think contributed to the low attendance (which I understand was really demoralizing for the professors). Second, the pre&ndash;activity system is very flawed. I think that PS2 Pal is an excellent supplemental tool, but as a required activity it falls flat. It doesn&#x27;t cover all the material that is needed (based on the pre&ndash;activity handout) and if you have had no exposure to that topic before, it is really hard to get a handle on things, even conceptually. I recommend releasing the pre&ndash;activity handout well before class and leaving PS2 Pal as an optional activity, or something you do after you&#x27;ve read through the material once. Third, the problem sets are often quite difficult, considering how much we&#x27;ve learned in class. Beginning with the problem set on rotational motion and for several weeks thereafter, I couldn&#x27;t do the problems without going to office hours (and I don&#x27;t know anyone who could). Overall, this class is quite poorly organized and is in need of a much better structure. Steve and Greg were both very kind and approachable professors and I know they had the very best of intentions. I hope that they will implement some of this feedback to improve future iterations of the course!</td>
