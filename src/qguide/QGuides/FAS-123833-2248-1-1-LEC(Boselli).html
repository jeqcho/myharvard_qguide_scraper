I think both have a lot of ups and downs. For LPSA, the coursework may be too demanding for someone with no experience but very slow for anyone with any AP experience. I took this class because I was worried about my chemistry knowledge. The last time I took chemistry before this course was sophomore year of high school, and I never learned about solubility or acids and bases. I found this class to be very easy and boring at times. I definitely don&#x27;t regret taking the class though. Many of my LS1A peers were much more stressed out than I was. If you are worried about the pace being too slow, probably take LS1A. However, I have heard from LS1A students that they end up learning very little. <br/>I did really like the teaching staff. Tucci is super interested in the subject, and he&#x27;s a very lively lecturer for 9AM. I also enjoyed the demonstrations, and the labs were very nice. I especially liked my lab TF. Dr. Boselli is very nice too, and she&#x27;s always willing to answer questions.<br/>While I did not attend help rooms, I was told they were extremely helpful to most students. If you are worried about receiving support, I strongly recommend LPSA. The staff will help you with any questions you have step by step. <br/>In terms of exams, as far as I&#x27;m aware, the LS1A exams are much easier. They are given a cheat sheet, and people say they&#x27;re easier than the PIEs. However, LPSA still has plenty of prep materials for the exam, and a lot of students do extremely well on them. <br/>I would recommend this course. I think it was a great course to take my freshmen fall.</td>

			<td class="TabularBody_LeftColumn" headers="comment-2_97ccf2bc-c960-4dc8-9b9e-a94a3e0c9b6a">As a course, LPSA is extremely interesting and engaging due to the course&#x27;s structure and focus on both Biology and Chemistry. Although the course is difficult at times, especially due to the contrast in topics covered, the amount of support provided allows everyone in the class to have the resources necessary to succeed and perform to the best of their abilities. While the course does have 3 midterms, a final, 12 problem sets and 4 Lab assignments, the almost endless amount of help rooms, peer coaching, and other forms of support make the daunting task of completing the course bearable. In particular, the TF for the course, Joe Gonzalez, was an immense help in the course, and provided great amounts of support, especially before exams. Overall, this course serves as an excellent introduction into the sciences at Harvard and teaches both important material on Biology and Chemistry, but on how to be a better learner as well.</td>

The classes allow you to recap some initial concepts while introducing more advanced ideas, which allowed me to develop the confidence to continue pursuing a career in this field. Some advice:<br/>&ndash;Make sure you follow ALL THE LECTURES, I know that 9am is challenging, but it&#x27;s worth it and everything will be much clearer after a good class.<br/>&ndash;The sections are extremely useful, especially if you have questions in Pset, since we basically solve questions very similar to those that will be there<br/>&ndash;Dedicate yourself to the Laboratory as much as possible, especially if you are a freshman. It was an opportunity to have my first contact with equipment that, at least for me, I had never seen, which took a lot of time to understand but was also very intriguing. <br/>&ndash;Finally, keep in mind that this course takes a lot of time and will be one of the ones you will have to dedicate the most to in your semester. Set aside time to read the pre&ndash;lectures, solve exercises and, above all, GO TO THE HELP ROOMS IN ADVANCE.</td>

This made lectures a bit of a pain to sit through occasionally, but the content is of course still interesting and fundamental if you&#x27;re going to take more biology courses at Harvard.

There is a lot of content to go over in a semester (basically the entirety of general chemistry and then basic cellular biology concepts), so the class will constantly feel fast paced. Go to help room EARLY to get psets done and explanations. Section is helpful to clarify confusing topics throughout the week&#x27;s lectures. This class took up so much of my time and was difficult at times, but once you gain good study habits and find your rhythm, it&#x27;s manageable.  I&#x27;ve learned a lot during this semester and have developed a deeper interest for cellular biology and would now say I&#x27;m on the same level as my LS1A peers or my peers with prior AP science experience. As for the final and tests, there are an abundance of resources to do well and study.

I had a great section leader, so that is a great place to ask questions in a smaller setting and review problems that look very similar to the questions on the problem set (I found that I was able to complete the problem sets much more efficiently when I waited until after my section to complete them). The amount of work you have is reasonable and the lab reports are not long, but still start earlier and go to office hours with any questions. Since the class is so large, office hours are almost always crowded, but it&#x27;s worth it to go, even if you have to wait before asking your questions, to get any issues sorted out before you submit your work.

However at many times I felt like I was expected to have prior knowledge when in reality I had no idea what I was doing. It scared me away from office hours. Don’t be scared. GO TO OFFICE HOURS! It’s their job to help you. I would also try to see what you can do on your own before going to office hours. Try to beat those kids who hog the TFs. I would get so mad because I just had to ask one question and they literally kept asking follow up questions WHEN THEY KNEW THE MATERIAL! Anyways, start PSETs early to grasp the concepts before it’s too late. Contact the arc tutoring center also. The more help the merrier. FIND FRIENDS WHO CAN EXPLAIN CONCEPTS.</td>

The concepts aren&#x27;t crazy hard but there are a huge amount of assignments (3 exams+final, PSET every week, 4&ndash;5 Prelabs and lab reports) and attendance is mandatory at most course components (lecture, section, lab etc.).

The curve and the grading is much better in this class, and there seem to be more resources to support students. I feel like if you want a refresher in chem before upper level classes, this is the class for you. LS1A is more bio focused.</td>

I never payed attention in lectures though. I got too distracted and rewatching the lectures in 2x speed in a quiet room with the notes opened helped a ton. don&#x27;t wait until the last minute though they can be 40ish mins long each even in 2x speed. Go to office hours with Joe (head TF) and if you have any questions about PSET or just a concept ask him he explains it very well. However, don&#x27;t ask him about lab questions. he is very smart and certified to answer, but the lab TF&#x27;s are looking for a specific answer on the lab report so just ask them. The most helpful thing that I did was reading the pre&ndash;lecture notes. the actual notes are okay but you can barely make sense of them. Go to section, and if you don&#x27;t finish the worksheet, they post the answers. I felt like I learned way more in section than I did in actual lecture. practice exams are way harder than actual exams so that&#x27;s good. if you don&#x27;t have a strong background in chem or bio you can still succeed in this class as long as you rewatch the lectures, read the pre&ndash;lectures, go to section, and go to office hours with JOE. dont bother asking a CA for help during office hours they may confuse you even more.</td>

The material is about half chemistry half biology so you get a taste of both, it is challenging but not overbearing, and you get some lab experience as well. There is a ridiculous amount of help available for people (like me) who struggle to keep up and need some extra support. The TFs and CAs are all awesome and very happy to help, the professors have a policy during lecture where you can just shout out a question if you don&#x27;t understand something, and there&#x27;s plenty of materials on Canvas to help as well. There are 3 lectures and a workshop every week so it does take a lot of room in your schedule, but there is only one PSET so not too much work outside of class if you pay attention during lecture. There are also 3 midterms so it does become quite a grind in the middle of the semester but if you stay on top of all the material and show up to the Practice Exam sessions you should be fine. Overall a great intro course full of lovely people!</td>

For context: I passed both AP Biology and AP Chemistry. To decide, I had a conversation with Prof. Amanda Spiewak, of the Chemistry and Chemical Biology Department. She was incredibly helpful in helping me make a decision. In short, she told me that LPSA would help me cover the bases of chemistry and biology all over again, to have those foundations strong for the rest of my Harvard undergraduate career. In contrast, LS1A would not so be an introductory course, but an introductory applications course, as this class covers not the theoretical aspects of biology and general chemistry, but their applications in introductory lights. <br/><br/>&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;<br/><br/>tl;dr: Both are really manageable if you have a background similar to mine, but I would recommend that, if you seek re&ndash;learning the foundations from a Harvard perspective, take LPSA! If you feel already confident and would like an introduction much more application&ndash;based, do LS1A.</td>
