This class makes philosophers and their ideas super accessible and easy to understand. Sandel is a fantastic lecturer and really great at teaching such a big class. TF&#x27;s vary but if you end up with a good one, it is such a rewarding experience. You will be pushed to think about concepts that you had taken for granted before. It is definitely a &#x27;you will take away what you put into it&#x27; type of class. As someone who tried to lock in to the class, it was such an enjoyable experience.</td>

I don&#x27;t think it is for everyone, and I would consider whether it fits your interests (some people seemed to only take it because it is a famous class, and they seemed not to properly enjoy it), but if it even is mildly interesting to you, you will not regret enrolling. Prof. Sandel is a spectacular lecturer and does an incredible job at engaging the entire class to debate all sides of many complex and interesting philosophies and ideas. Prof. Sandel also brought in incredible guest speakers which allowed for even more takes on these ideas. Totally worth the time!</td>

Don&#x27;t feel pressured to speak in class, you can share your thoughts in section! I couldn&#x27;t recommend this class more highly&ndash; Professor Sandel is incredible.

			<td class="TabularBody_LeftColumn" headers="comment-2_15d752ab-2302-4cb1-ad86-bf8343e67e7c">I feel that this class is quite inaccessible in terms of the terminology used, which is a confusion that seeps into conversations in section and in my experience, made me incredibly confused as to what was going on half the time. Differentiating terms like &quot;moral&quot;, &quot;good&quot;, &quot;reason&quot;, &quot;will&quot;, &quot;right&quot;, &quot;desert&quot; and so many more was challenging for me, as I had to shed previous understandings of those words, since in this class, they mean something different. Additionally, my TF was extremely unavailable during the essay&ndash;writing process, and as someone who has never written a philosophy paper before, having almost no guidance was daunting and a very stressful experience. If you can write philosophy and utilize those nitty gritty terms when you speak, this class might be for you—I couldn&#x27;t do either, so it wasn&#x27;t for me.</td>

			<td class="TabularBody_LeftColumn" headers="comment-2_15d752ab-2302-4cb1-ad86-bf8343e67e7c">This course gives a superficial introduction to philosophy and some interesting debates of modernity. Although Professor Sandel is fantastic and a great instructor, most of the debates we had in class and in section were completely unproductive because people did not take them seriously or were often unable to understand basic questions. Since the course was so big, the grading did not make sense at all and TFs would not give satisfactory feedback or accept regrade requests. This class had a lot of potential, but it was extremely poorly organized. Since it was so popular, I often would get to the lecture hall and not be able to find seats, because there would be so many visitors and auditors, which makes me wonder what are the priorities of the course heads.</td>

			<td class="TabularBody_LeftColumn" headers="comment-2_15d752ab-2302-4cb1-ad86-bf8343e67e7c">This course was quite interesting and taught me a lot of stuff, but a little underwhelming. I didn&#x27;t really feel any true revelations or moments of fascination but there were parts of the lectures when students could get a good laugh and it would be entertaining (Professor Sandel has a great sense of humor). The workload was quite manageable &ndash; mandatory lecture attendance, two short essays, one final exam that was not too hard. I definitely spent a longer amount of time on this class than expected because I was unfamiliar with philosophical writing but the experience overall was not too stressful. Recommend for the chance to learn from Professor Sandel and build a basic foundational knowledge of philosophy. If you were looking for anything too deep, this GENED might not be the right fit.</td>

			<td class="TabularBody_LeftColumn" headers="comment-2_15d752ab-2302-4cb1-ad86-bf8343e67e7c">TAKE THIS CLASSSSSSSS!!! If you are to take one class this semester, this has to be the one. I don’t want to hear any “argh I should’ve taken it, but it didn’t fit in my schedule”. You have 32 classes, don’t be daft, swap one out. Through this class, your idea about what is right and wrong will break apart, and it will test everything you thought to be true and established in your beliefs. It will be weird, but it’s essential!!!</td>

			<td class="TabularBody_LeftColumn" headers="comment-2_15d752ab-2302-4cb1-ad86-bf8343e67e7c">If you really like philosophical discussions, and do well locking into a big lecture and participating, or if you just want to take a class with Michael Sandel, I would say take this class, although maybe take it pass fail. Your experience for this course especially depends on if you have a good tF who cares about their students and doesn&#x27;t believe in the power hierarchy that this class subscribes to, and if you have no background with philosophical papers, the first assignment will be a struggle. Also, because of the size of the course, the teaching team is also super big, and relies on a system of hierarchy that you must navigate if you need accomodations of any kind, which can be stressful to deal with. The overall consensus among students seems to be that this class can be a hit or miss depending on who you get as your TF, how much you like delving into philosophical texts, how well you can pay attention in a huge discussion lecture that has students debating with one another for large chunks of the time, and how stringent the teaching team is about random things like computer use in class and what you are doing with your phone throughout lecture. This course does fulfill the ethics and civics gened requirement and the theory subfield of gov though, so it is useful in that regard. Taking this with friends always does make it easier.</td>

			<td class="TabularBody_LeftColumn" headers="comment-2_15d752ab-2302-4cb1-ad86-bf8343e67e7c">I think this class is a fantastic way to fulfill a GenEd requirement—I would strongly recommend it even if you already fulfilled it, or to simply audit the class and listen in on lectures (which is essentially the entire point of the class—section wasn&#x27;t particularly engaging for me). Sandel is a great lecturer and does a wonderful job of prompting students to think more deeply. While students may sometimes respond with surface&ndash;level answers, or answer in a way that does not address the moral dilemmas that Sandel loves to propose, he does a good job of prodding students&#x27; thought processes until they reach the heart of the issue together. I loved hearing other students&#x27; thoughts and arguments, and it is generally just a fun time to ponder over the questions that Sandel poses. The essay topics  were generally interesting to think about (and you have multiple topics to pick from),  and section is an alright time to develop your thoughts, though I found them to be pretty repetitive of lecture, which is really the main point of the course. Overall, definitely the best GenEd I have taken.</td>

You will leave with a new found understanding of how to think about Justice and ethical issues and the class challenges you to think out of your confort zone. If you really do the readings and show up to section eager to talk, you will get a lot more out of the class. Try and speak in lecture for the full experience!</td>

Even as a STEM major, I would have taken it as an elective. Sitting in Sanders lectures, you truly feel like you are living the Harvard experience. And an added bonus is that since all your friends are taking it as well, lunch discussions turn from gossip sessions to philosophical debates about topics raised in lectures. My one comment is this GenEd is not an &quot;easy A&quot; as the curve is pretty harsh. You definitely have to study for the final at the end of the semester. This wouldn&#x27;t preclude me from taking it (I thought it was awesome and totally worth it) but is just something to consider as you choose Geneds.</td>

Every week, Sanders would be packed with students. Professor Sandel creates an environment where students&#x27; opinion drives the direction of the class. I think this year was unique because it was the first time Justice has been offered in nearly a decade. This made a larger portion of the school take the course. In terms of course material, I think this class provides a great introduction to philosophy and brings us to question our own moral leanings and see intention behind our inclinations. This class was not an easy A, and there was a general lack of guidance on what graders were looking for. Additionally, due to the sheer numbers of enrolled, I think standardization among TFs was not clear as well. However, if given the chance, I would take Justice and other courses taught by Professor Sandel again. It will be a memorable part of my academic journey here.</td>

Neither lectures nor section were focused on comprehension or tactics to improve comprehension of relatively dense political philosophy &ndash;&ndash; as one would expect from what is, essentially, an introductory political philosophy class.  Sandel is clearly very smart and interesting, but I think he would be much more interesting in a seminar&ndash;style class where you actually get to engage with him, rather than in a 900 person lecture.

However, all other parts of the course were struggling. Also, most TFs spent their time during lecture on power trips yelling at people to put their phone away (yes you can only use paper&#x2F;pencil in lecture). Also, the course felt like a semester long thought expxreiment until the final, when we had to actually study and reproduce all of the philosophical theory that we learned in the readings&#x2F;lecture but never talked about in assignments or short responses.

I do NOT want to hear two students argue about their opinions in a 900 person lecture—not only are student opinions typically not well framed within the constructs discussed (rather, purely personal opinions), it’s just so incredibly boring and frustrating, and frankly a waste of my time. I wanted to hear Professor Sandel teach, but instead I got the mindless ramblings of my uneducated peers. Less time hearing irritating student opinions would have definitely made this a better class because the core content and readings were actually very interesting.<br/><br/>Section was the best thing about this course, Yannic was awesome and everything I learned came from him.

The course is incredibly strict and harsh. If you came to lecture 2 minutes early they would yell at you for being late. They wouldn&#x27;t grant extensions for reasonable accommodations (I had professional interviews throughout the semester and I asked the course for extensions weeks in advance, and they only replied to my email a few days before the deadlines, denying all of my extension requests). They had a crazy strict no electronics policy and wouldn&#x27;t let you use your phone at all in class (I pulled my phone out for literally 3 seconds to check a text, and a TF swooped down and harshly reprimanded me and told me if i used my phone again he&#x27;d have to take it away). The grading was insanely harsh and arbitrary for the papers. The TFs were the meanest people on the planet. I literally have liked all my classes at Harvard all 4 years, and while the content of the class was pretty interesting, the class itself was terrible. I would not recommend this class to a single person, and I hope that they seriously revise this course or never teach it again.</td>

If Justice had been isolated entirely to merely its lectures, then it would be course that I could recommend entirely and would likely be one of my favorite courses. However, where Justice stumbles is in the overall logistical overview of the course outside of the lectures. <br/><br/>To start with the good, Michael Sandel is and has always been one of the greatest lecturers of the generation. Hearing that this course would be offered this semester, I made the necessary scheduling changes to take the course &ndash; which I do not regret at all. Hearing Sandel lecture in Sanders is an iconic image that I will remember for a long, long time. Furthermore, the visitors that we had &ndash; from Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson to professors in institutions all across the United States &ndash; were some of the most interesting experiences I had, and their viewpoints were extremely knowledgeable and interesting. Sandel teaches in a way that is unbelievably intuitive, and he complements the readings with such well&ndash;crafted lectures. Finally, his office hours gave the opportunity to express my own opinions in small sessions with Sandel, and he is just as well&ndash;spoken in these more impromptu sessions. <br/><br/>However, Justice is let down by its logistics. While the sections are informative and interesting, there is a sense of disconnect between the students and the teaching staff. Important information about exams and assignments is often withheld until the final moments, and thus it is extremely difficult to get a full picture of what we are supposed to do. Furthermore, some of the policies that the class instituted, particularly with regards to screens and lateness, while coming from a good place, ended up being enforced in a draconian manner that did little more than ruin the experience of the class for me and many of my classmates. For such a large class, issues such as these are expected, but the frequency that they occurred in Justice makes me feel that the teaching staff simply were not ready to deal with the problems that come with a class this large. <br/><br/>Therefore, I don&#x27;t know where I would rate Justice. In terms of what I learned, this was one of the greatest classes I took at Harvard. However, in terms of being a class, Justice is one of the worst experiences I have had so far at this school.</td>

Lectures are interesting and Sandel is a great lecturer, but having to sit there for a two&ndash;hour block at 9.45am did start getting to me once the semester ramped up.

I enjoy debates, philosophy, had thought about these themes before. etc. but the policies are harsh. No electronic devices (i get it, but some people take notes better by typing than writing for organization and clarity purposes), and the gradings can be harsh. They try to standardize across sections and are not very nice in grading. It seems that they want to try to make the course harder than it&#x27;s supposed to be.

It’s structured like a philosophy survey class, so you get exposure to a lot of different philosophical perspectives. Sandel does a good job explaining the material in class, so the no screens policy was helpful for actually taking in what he has to say since the lectures can mostly substitute for the readings (but still do them since they help with the essays). The essays aren’t too bad, they just take some getting used to since they aren’t as empirical&#x2F;evidence based as the papers you write in other classes, as they focus more on the moral reasoning behind a policy decision. People make talking in lecture a big deal, but don’t worry too much about it since you can avoid speaking if you want to and just listen to everyone else’s bad takes. Section probably makes or breaks the class since if you have a good section leader they can go over the material and guide section discussions in a meaningful way, and they also grade your papers and final. Overall, I really enjoyed the class and would recommend it for this Gened req.</td>

The way Sandel holds the class somehow makes the massive Sanders lecture feel like a Sever section. Sandel is so great at holding ideas, facilitating conversation, and interpreting difficult wordings into tangible ideas. There are only 3 real assignments (including the finals), so attendance is a pretty important part, plus you&#x27;re in the presence of the honorable Sandel, so you might as well stay the whole time. They grade pretty harshly on the essays and sometimes give no feedback. Also, try your best to go to Sandel&#x27;s office hours. Not attending will forever be my biggest regret.

It actually made me reconsider my ideas, and I felt comfortable sharing them and also changing my mind out loud. Justice has actually made me consider going to law school and sparked an interest in moral philosophy. Lecture, though can get boring at times, is really cool, and I loved the in&ndash;class debates. We had some incredible guests, including Supreme Court Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson &ndash; that was such a unique and incredible experience that could really only happen at Harvard.

Like truly awful. Disorganized, unnecessarily strict, and at times, a bit mean. Though my TF fostered an incredible section experience, he was not nice. Many of the TFs are future corporate lawyers with power trips, who communicate in a manner not suitable for an undergraduate general education course. The papers are graded quite harshly, and the grading is so ambiguous. I actually have no idea what my final grade will be. And the final &ndash; SO POORLY ORGANIZED. They released information clarifying the format literally three days before. The other really large courses at Harvard are run much much much better than Justice.

He is passionate and enthusiastic, and his lectures are such a pleasure to attend and participate in. If Prof. Sandel ever decides to teach Justice again (or perhaps a different course but with the same interactive format), do make sure to raise your hand and give your opinion: it’s a truly magical experience. <br/><br/>In terms of material, the course was very interesting and insightful. While more or less following the traditional syllabus (Bentham, Mill, Kant, Rawls, etc.), this year’s rendition of the course introduced a number of original topics that had not been discussed previously. This was definitely a breath of fresh air compared to the trolley problem which, at this point, 99% of people know. <br/><br/>The final thing I’d like to say is this: do your readings. This pertains to any humanities class, not just Justice. I was silly enough and did not really do the readings throughout the semester. When final exam time came around, I was super stressed because of this. Of course, as I said above, the exam went really well. But still, I highly recommend that you do the assigned readings. Not only will you feel more confident when the final exam comes, but you’ll actually learn a lot from the readings and experience intellectual growth as a result. When I sat down to read some of the shorter texts in the last few days before the exam, I realized how much I had been missing out on. So please, please, please, don’t repeat my mistake and DO THE READINGS!!</td>

This is the most poorly structured, inconsistent, arbitrary, unreasonable, and frustrating class I have ever had the displeasure of taking during my four years here, and I would not wish the experience of taking this class upon anyone. Regardless of your motives for considering this class—whether you’re looking for an interesting GENED class, fulfilling a concentration requirement, or seeking to learn more about philosophy—there are better alternatives that will meet your goals without compromising your sanity. Some specific feedback: <br/><br/>1. The TFs were very inconsistent in feedback and grading. I understand that a certain amount of inconsistency is inevitable, but the scale of the discrepancies between grading and feedback between the TFs in this class was ridiculous and a sign of far bigger issues than chance, such as unclear standards for grading and feedback or ineffective management to hold all TFs to these standards. A TF told me the TFs and admins were well aware of the discrepancies; there was even a three&ndash;tier pyramid of TF grading strictness. The majority of TFs were too strict, some were “just right,” and very few were “too nice”. My TF admitted all of the TFs grade differently. There was also large discrepancies in the feedback received on outlines and papers. Some TFs gave a few one&ndash;word pieces of feedback (“Nice”) while others received paragraphs. These arbitrary discrepancies are egregious and unfair to all students. <br/>2. Students were held to unrealistically high standards. According to another TF, scoring a 96 or above on papers required the inclusion of “original philosophical ideas,” which is clearly an unreasonable standard to hold students to in an introductory class. Apparently, TFs also needed to receive special permission from the head TFs to hand out scores of 96 or above (which, of course, disincentivizes higher scores). <br/>3. My TF also refused to let students know where points were taken off or the “full feedback” (the feedback they gave was only “Good” and “Nice” but they would deduct points heavily from those sections anyway). They cited course policy as the reason for not telling students where points were deducted or the feedback on these deductions. How can students improve if they’re not told what they’re doing wrong?<br/>4. The syllabus was missing basic information, such as assignment dates, late policy, grading scale, etc. Yet, they deducted heavily for late assignments anyway, even without providing written information on the late policy. My TF told me the reading list was released one week at a time because they didn’t want students to read ahead, but there’s zero excuse to not include the other information. <br/><br/>On the plus side, we had Kentaji Brown Jackson as a guest speaker. Otherwise, the course was absolutely a waste of time, and I deeply regret taking it overall.</td>

Professor Sandel is a standout lecturer whose grasp of the material and of ethical reasoning is unmatched among professors of our time. The workload in terms of reading and the two papers is by no means overwhelming, and if you find interest in the readings, it will feel like leisure more than work anyway. If you take this course, I would strongly recommend reading Sandel&#x27;s book Justice beforehand &ndash;&ndash; you might be a little bit less captivated in lecture, but having the background will be valuable context for the class discussion.</td>

That said, the online YouTube videos do encapsulate this course well, so if you&#x27;re reading this and can&#x27;t take the course, definitely recommend the YouTube series.

Sandel is an exceptional lecturer, and his reputation and influence (bringing Justice Jackson to class was incredible) bring significant value to the experience. However, for a professor with such a deep background in philosophical inquiry, spending their life investigating various questions of justice, ethics, and merit, it’s disappointing that the course focuses so little on his own perspectives and refutations (his books actively criticize Rawls while the course introduces minimal critiques). Instead, it often leaves the discussion to undergraduates who may lack the depth to engage meaningfully with the material.<br/><br/>While the in&ndash;class debates were intriguing, the format naturally has its limitations. You have to consider the type of student who would want to share their opinion (especially on topics such as affirmative action and reparations) in front of 800 other students. The dialogues were often narrow and incredibly uninformed, to which Sandel only facilitated as opposed to contributing or elaborating.<br/><br/>The course seems more focused on presenting what historical philosophers have thought rather than challenging students to develop their own critical thinking skills. The course could so easily take up a “teach you how to think” pedagogy but instead defaults to “teach you what others thought.” The final exam reinforced this issue by emphasizing memorization and regurgitation of philosophical ideas rather than encouraging original analysis or thought.<br/><br/>The papers also fell short. Expectations were poorly communicated, with rubrics and guidelines varying across TFs. In a class as large as Justice, minimizing inconsistency is incredibly important. The paper topics seemed disconnected from the course’s broader themes and failed to provide an opportunity to “explore Justice,” as the course attempts to beg. Combined with the superficial engagement with philosophical perspectives during lectures, the papers felt more like busywork and a way to draw a normal distribution of grades for a large class than an opportunity for intellectual exploration and growth.<br/><br/>Section was a benefit — unfiltered debates and development of opinions.<br/><br/>Overall, the course feels like an introduction to surface&ndash;level philosophy rather than an opportunity to inspire and cultivate new ways of thinking. A stronger focus on developing students&#x27; own philosophical perspectives would greatly improve its value. While Justice likely won’t be taught again, if the course were to make a reappearance, my advice to the teaching team would be to make the course feel like a class — not a production.</td>

The lectures are extremely long and the people who raise their hands are doing it more for the attention then to actually contribute to the conversation. Sandel is very good at asking follow up questions to try to extract something minimally useful, but overall it just felt like the proposal of having people speak really just wasted time. Sections were fun and did provide some interesting discussions. The papers were a pain especially because of the so little feedback during the writing of the paper and after the grades were released. Very harsh grading in a GENED course that is supposed to expose people to philosophy, I really don&#x27;t understand why they&#x27;d grade so harshly papers from 500 students from different backgrounds and completely different concentrations and goals with this class. The highest grade I saw people getting on the papers was a 92. Insane coming from a GENED class which is supposedly to foster intellectual curiosity. Overall, light work but harsh grading so pick your poison. Class structure having people speak in Sanders really needs some rethinking. Personally, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this class.</td>

It was cool to get to openly discuss opinions about issues of morality and justice, particularly in section. With that being said, there are some very valid complaints to be had (I am sure other reviews will dive more into them) about the draconian way in which lecture was run. This article also gives some details: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.thecrimson.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;2024&#x2F;10&#x2F;11&#x2F;ruiz&ndash;michael&ndash;sandel&ndash;greatest&ndash;injustice&#x2F;. Hopefully, next time they run the course, they change that policy to make students more enthusiastic about coming to lecture and engaging with the material. Additionally, the Gened department should stop purposefully trying to make Gened courses give out lower grades &ndash;&ndash; the purpose of Gened courses is to learn about topics important to general education (such as ethics and civics) that we would not normally learn about in our concentration. Given that students have less background in these topics, grading should not be made harder just so Harvard can achieve some arbitrary goal of how many A&#x27;s they give out in order to curb grade inflation. That is not the purpose of teaching whatsoever. I found that assignments were often graded in an incredibly picky nature in this class, and the only logical reason seemed to be that Harvard did not want everyone getting high grades in this class. With that being said, interesting material that I learned a lot from, and with some changes, I would highly recommend the class.</td>

Attendance is 100% mandatory and you&#x27;re only able to skip section due to a Dean&#x27;s excuse. However, the course is structured well so that you are sort of forced to learn. The essays are graded pretty harshly, so even if you do manage to BS it, you&#x27;re required to put in some effort. Otherwise, if the essays were still easy for you (or for me &ndash;&ndash; they were pretty hard), you can see the flip side when you get to the final. I&#x27;m more of a final exam kind of person. The exam tested your ability to identify key authors just by quotes (out of context), and then choose 10 out of 11 prompts to write your paragraphs on.

It did not live up to expectations. <br/><br/>The pros: Justice is a friendly introductory course to philosophy and exposes you to some key philosophical thinkers. Sandel is a legend in this field (and at Harvard) and the course is different from the recorded version online, although IMO the new version is a step down. <br/><br/>The cons: First, student participation from the audience skews largely Freshman who did debate and want to talk for the sake of talking rather than engage with the actual philosophical content that Sandel is trying to direct students towards (there have been some WILD statements made in this class). Second, the attempt to cover a wide range of philosophical thinkers AND apply them to modern day topic resulted in a glass that just ended up being stretched too thin and lost some of the core persuasive content that Justice Jackson referenced about the class. <br/><br/>If you are someone who does care about grades, be careful of which TF you choose because mine was way too picky and my grade suffered as a result. There’s no way to really standardize grades because papers are all graded by your TF (and the final too!)</td>

I learned how to view the world and its systems through a philosophical lens. <br/><br/>I saw how influential Nozick and Hayek&#x27;s Libertarian perspectives were in shaping the United States&#x27; and Britain&#x27;s political and economic systems. I critically thought about what parents are morally obligated to do for their children, and how I would want to raise my child. Instead of having an emotional reaction to a heated topic such as banning burkas in France, I was able to truly understand the rationale of both sides of the argument and formulate my own opinion based on that. <br/><br/>These are just some examples of what a semester of Justice gave me. I feel like a smarter and more capable person; I am able to use this framework of philosophies and critically think about how I should live my life and how others think the world &#x27;ought&#x27; to be.  On the latter point, I believe this is a strength of Justice; in that you hear what your peers have to say on certain topics and also hear Sandel&#x27;s response. <br/><br/>Of course, there is choice in the matter of workload. Justice is not going to be one&#x27;s hardest course in the semester and one can coast in Justice. I did not fully complete the readings until the final exam. The workload for me was at most 1 hour on the weeks we did not have an essay due, and about 5&ndash;8 hours on the weeks we did have an essay due.

They literally infantalize the 900ish kids in the class by trying to act like parents concerned about screen time and yelling at kids for going on their phones in lecture and by taking away credit for showing up late 10 minutes to the 2 hour lecture. They provided little information about assignments in the course and grading on assignments was quite harsh. I wound up being lucky enough to have a great TF for my section, but I went to a few other sections and wow, the TFs were close&ndash;minded, infantalizing, and uninsightful. Speaking of uninsightful, Sandel does clearly know all of the course content well, but rarely did he make a remark that seemed truly illuminating.

This class is just two hours of Sandel repeating his own book aloud interspersed with commentary from some of the worst gesticulators on this campus.  I am a senior. All of the GENEDs I have taken have been terrible. This was in the bottom half. If they make this class smaller (no more than 200 people), then consider enrolling. Otherwise, it is a complete waste of time because you will not really learn anything, and you will spend your time as I did — listening to the guy behind you snore as you use a tiny telescope to see whichever rando has decided to flap their gums into a microphone. And even if you do pay attention, all you will learn is the baby basics of philosophy, or the equivalent of two hours of YouTube. I will say, the guest speakers were excellent, particularly Randall Kennedy and Justice Jackson. But in the universe of interesting guest lectures that is Harvard University, this course is just not worth it. I ended up taking it pass fail because of how few grades you actually get (two essays and the final) and lowkey regret it. I did none of the readings for the entire course and will likely still do well. If that appeals to you, then I give you my blessing. Go ahead. Enroll.

Debates allow you to get a real opinion of your classmates, and moreover, Sandel always asks such questions that you doubt your opinion very quickly! Definitely helps you not to look at an issue flat and think more broadly. It&#x27;s amazing how at the beginning of the course I thought that many of the questions were obvious and that there could be no contrary view, but at the end of the course I was questioning every opinion and realizing how complicated everything is. This course is more philosophy than political science, but a lot of the lecture material really sheds light on the events of the political world today. I really liked the fact that there were always some videos at the lectures, which helped me to better digest the material visually.

I would recommend you take this course if you are interested in philosophical thinking about topics like abortion or affirmative action. &quot;What should we do?&quot; is the normative question you should expect to answer in papers.</td>

We had amazing guest speakers (Ketanji Brown Jackson, Margaret H Marshall, Randall Kennedy, etc) and learned about so many philosophers. The workload consisted of two essays (graded a bit roughly), and a final that was surprisingly not that hard if you reviewed the basic ideologies of the core philosophers of the class.

The 900 person lecture and handing the microphone to a few select people is widely ineffective. The teaching staff and Professor Sandel do not create a safe and comfortable enough environment for enough people to want to speak. I, myself, and along with my friends never felt comfortable enough to speak in that class because of how we could be percieved. And this goes beyond just differing because we debate on ethical dilemmas. I found that Professor Sandel does not do a good job keeping the class and environment in control. Yes, people will write on sidechat about you, making fun of your viewpoints that you shared with class. People will also audibly laugh at you.<br/><br/>Another issue is the effectiveness of these class discussions. That is the purpose of section. I do not attend a 2 hour class to hear other people speak. I would like to be taught by the professor and not have to listen to classmates debate on their personal views and opinions. Because of this, the class was unnecessarily long. This class could be a regular class, cover the same material better, and leave the debates for section.<br/><br/>The TFs are law school&#x2F;grad school students that hold you to the same rigorous standard as them. They expect you to write these perfect papers on difficult philosophical concepts and will mercilessly deduct points when you don&#x27;t write at the level they can write. But when you receive your grade, you won&#x27;t find a lot of comments for improvement. I recieved a 90&#x2F;100 on one paper but I had only 2 comments for improvement (one was to watch a quote that I did not close) and another to provide another sentence of reasoning. The grades I received did not reflect the comments given which made it difficult to improve for the following paper. The TFs were also very difficult about what support they could lend you. You could only ask hyper&ndash;specific questions and they decide whether or not they can answer you. Once they review your outline, you cannot receive any more feedback on your work, after a certain time they do not respond to any questions regardless of what it is. I just found this all to be even more difficult than it needed to be. I did not feel supported at all at any point while in this course.<br/><br/>This class attracts some of the most stereotypical Harvard know&ndash;it&ndash;all elites. People will walk up to Professor Sandel after class and kiss up to him, saying things like &quot;You are so inspirational&quot; or &quot;I used you watch your show with my mom as a kid so this is a dream com true for me&quot; you just hear this weekly after class and you&#x27;re trying to get to your next class or people shoving you out of the way to talk to him or sign their book.<br/><br/>There is no reason a basic GENED should be this stressful, difficult, and foster such a toxic environment.<br/><br/>However, I have to concede it does have some pros:<br/><br/>This class was structured very well. It was helpful to go essentially philosopher by philosopher. I also think this class did a good job of not cramming too many philosophers and ideas in for such a limited time. I felt that I had enough time to grasp each concept and thinker very well.<br/><br/>This class also did a good job introducing me to critical ideas and perspectives of various philosophers as they pertain to justice and equality.<br/><br/>Professor Sandel is clearly very intelligent on these subjects and they way he explains even the most difficult concept is amazing.<br/><br/>Sections can be nice &amp; helpful with the right TF and good classmates.</td>

It&#x27;s not necessarily life&ndash;changing like many will make it out to be, but it is certainly worth taking and sparks many deep debates and conversations among students. It&#x27;s a huge course so you&#x27;ll undoubtedly know others taking it, which makes it even better. The grading was frustratingly opaque at many times. It&#x27;s fine in my opinion for a course to curve grades down or set caps on the maximum grades for assignments, but they must be upfront about the fact that they are doing so. This course refused to acknowledge that it was doing so, which just led to lots of people putting significant effort into their assignments and getting scores that didn&#x27;t reflect their work. And I say this as a student who still received A marks on all of their work speaking mostly on behalf of my friends in the course. There are broader conversations to be had about the right and wrong ways to increase the &quot;rigor&quot; of gen ed courses, but I think the way this course went about doing that was wrong and misguided. This course already has the makings of an incredible gen ed: engaging and instructional lectures, well&ndash;made assignments, incredible sections, and a good final exam. It should be no surprise that most students learn a lot in a course as well done as this course, but there must also then be room for all of those students to be rewarded fairly for their learning and time invested. For example, the sample essay outlines and introduction paragraphs we were shown toward the beginning of the course &quot;so that everyone would be on the same page about grading standards&quot; suggested far more lenient grading than what ultimately was done. And it was not always clear exactly what the goals of the essays were (where the balance should be between philosophical arguments, the provided resources, and independent arguments). I personally submitted two essays that received virtually zero negative feedback, yet lost a combined 15 points in grading for which I was provided zero explanation. These grades were ultimately fine, but any constructive feedback would have been appreciated. Lastly, the TF staff were over&ndash;the&ndash;top during lectures about trying to stop students from using their devices. While I respect the end of trying to increase student engagement and limit distractions to other students, the process through which this was attempted was extremely counterproductive. TFs regularly interrupted students who were themselves paying attention, asking those students to tap other students on their phones to get their attention so the TFs could get them off of their phones.  The TF staff were unnecessarily rude to students who were only briefly on their devices, and those same TFs would hypocritically pull out their own ipads and laptops to take notes on the lectures immediately after bothering students. Having them walk around during lecture like hall monitors felt incredibly childish and beneath the institution of Harvard.  Most importantly to the course, it was very distracting and subtracted from the lecture experience.</td>

I began this semester without the slightest interest in philosophy mostly because I had no idea how&#x2F;where to start learning. With his energetic and interactive lectures, Professor Sandel has completely changed my perspective on the field. I never wanted to miss a lecture because of how incredible Professor Sandel was in engaging his audience to learn and care about political philosophy. His ability to teach philosophy through storytelling was one of the best parts of this course. <br/><br/>My TF Roshni continued the energy of Sanders Theatre into our sections. Her section is where my interest in philosophy really took form and evolved. She was always enthusiastic and inviting to all her students, encouraging everyone to voice their opinions and engage in lively debate. I only wish our section was longer because her instruction really was a highlight of this semester. Roshni was always willing to fit you into her office hours, even on a last minute notice, and she made each assignment more approachable and less daunting. I struggled a bit to write a draft of the first paper, but by the second paper I was excited to write and pen my thoughts mostly because Roshni guided and empowered us to engage with the material earnestly and confidently. I am really grateful I took her section. <br/><br/>Overall, the course was absolutely a delight.  The guest speakers were incredible, and I appreciated Professor Sandel&#x27;s efforts to challenge the opinions of other professors and judges. Everyone at Harvard should take this course or watch the older lectures online if the course isn&#x27;t offered again!  I am leaving this class a completely different person, and I have Justice and its teaching team to thank for that.</td>

It’s not really just about the lectures Professor Sandel gives or the philosophy you read, it’s more about the students and the fascinating arguments they make and how much people seem to be willing to listen to each other and change their minds.<br/><br/>The sections are also really fun and you’ll learn a lot about how the other students think and how to express your arguments more clearly and persuasively.</td>

No rubrics or sample papers are given out to the students, and our papers are graded harshly without much justification and comments from the TFs. You will likely get a comment saying that &quot;this paper is great&quot; and subsequently end up with a grade in the B range. Some TFs hosted extra study session for the finals, while others do not even give very clear comment on papers or just general questions I may have.  Justice has a very strict standard for students&#x27; writing that goes against what you learn in Expos or Hum 10. You will get your points taken off if you do not write in a specific way which they don&#x27;t tell you beforehand. And you will have to write like how you probably would in high school — a longer version of a five paragraph structure where the counterargument has to come at a certain point. I was taught in Expos to move away from this type of writing and was forced back into it because of Justice. <br/><br/>The course content itself is also poorly organized. It does not move in a chronological way nor any other way that may seem &quot;progressive.&quot; You will likely leave the class knowing a bunch of philosophers and their theories, but not finding any satisfaction.</td>

The guest speakers are definitely a highlight—speakers like Ketanji Brown Jackson, Chief Justice Margaret Marshall, and others bring a real&ndash;world perspective that enriches the material and helps connect theory to practice. Sandel is a fantastic professor, with an engaging teaching style that encourages participation and makes even the most complex ideas accessible.<br/><br/>That said, be prepared for some challenges, especially if you don&#x27;t have a background in philosophy. The writing assignments, particularly the essays, are tough and require you to write normative arguments using philosophical theories. If you’ve never done this before, I’d recommend seeking additional resources or support on how to approach this type of writing. The final exam was more manageable with the study guide, but the papers require more practice and clarity. Also, the section discussions could be more engaging, especially considering the large class size. Try to be proactive in participating, but don’t be afraid to ask for more clarification or help with the assignments if needed. Overall, this course is a great opportunity to explore big questions about justice and to engage with some truly inspiring thinkers. Definitely very pleased I took this class though as it was an amazing experience and an iconic  Harvard course and very notable professor!</td>

Throughout the course, we were never asked or prepared to memorize multiple of the philosopher&#x27;s ideas and be able to regurgitate them. Also, the essays were graded SO harshly for a class that does NOT teach you how to write or how to prepare. They threw an essay at us, and then when some people were not as good (due to being STEM majors or just not having this type of writing experience), they punished us with bad grades.</td>

However, this class definitely did not live up to the hype. While the guest debates were entertaining(though some of the guest speakers were interesting characters) and hearing from Ketanji Brown&ndash;Jackson was cool, I don&#x27;t feel like anyone gained much from engaging with the class. I switched to P&#x2F;F once I realized this. The essays are graded super harshly, there was no standardization across TFs and sections, and we didn&#x27;t get any information about the final until the end of the semester. The course policies were also very annoying. If you can take P&#x2F;F, take it and if not find something else. Sandel also doesn&#x27;t give interesting lectures and just spends time summarizing the slides and moderating debates for students or guests. Would&#x27;ve liked to actually hear him teach something or share his ideas instead of just sharing the ideas of others.</td>
