Even if you don&#x27;t like history or want to try to learn history in a new way, TAKE THIS CLASS. The assignments are super chill and lecture is super interesting. I can&#x27;t glaze this class enough.<br/><br/>1) The professors and TFs are helpful and willing to talk to you about anything. You can discuss your concerns about the course, topics you want to discuss, and anything else.  The professors are knowledgeable in different subjects. Professor Jasanoff is knowledgeable about British empire history, Professor Weld is knowledgeable about Latin American history, and Professor Lepore is knowledgeable about U.S. history. You have three amazing professors with different subjects of interest in one class, and it&#x27;s amazing how they combine all their expertise into one class and somehow connect it all. Lectures are super interesting and are a large part of your grade. You will start to want to go to the lecture, and that&#x27;s how interesting this class is. During lectures, they have segments at the beginning of the class to ask students about recent news and questions they want to ask, and they are super engaging and want to talk to you. They took the feedback well during midterm feedback and improved the course even in the middle of the semester.<br/><br/>2) The Section is also super interesting. It&#x27;s a bit nerve&ndash;wracking at first imo, but you can always discuss your concerns with your TF regarding section discussion and assignment grading. I had Hagar, and she&#x27;s amazing. She&#x27;s super flexible and responds to emails quickly. She even bought us cookies during one of the sections (another reason why you should take the class).<br/><br/>3) You don&#x27;t write a history paper in this class, which can be good or bad depending on your interests. However, this class mainly emphasizes thinking and drafting papers as if you were going to write one, and it&#x27;s super stress&ndash;relieving and more engaging to get feedback on your process without worrying about writing a huge essay at the end. If you&#x27;re confused, please schedule office hours with your TF, you can usually get all your feedback and questions in at least 30 minutes, and they are super helpful in guiding you to what they want when grading. It&#x27;s three essays around the end of each month. If you get started early after you finish the essay beforehand, it&#x27;s genuinely a light courseload. <br/><br/>In conclusion, take HIST 10!! Super rewarding and interesting class, and I&#x27;d take it again if I could.</td>

The professors are biased, the grading is horrible, and the students are super one&ndash;minded and won&#x27;t change their minds about anything. I&#x27;m not even conservative but this class silenced those views completely. The professors were not nice at all (one time, Prof. Weld shouted at a student whose phone rang off by mistake, and another time Prof. Lepore called me out and embarrassed me in front of the entire class for checking a text from my family member).  The grading was so arbitrary, there was no rubric for any of our assignments, and people literally got horrible grades for no reason (on the first paper, half my class got a D).</td>

It didn&#x27;t specifically give an introduction to the study of history, but it asked students to question the field: what is specifically is history? how is history recorded? how should we interpret hisotry and accounts of history? why is history important? what can we learn from studying history? why is it important? These were all pretty wide&ndash;open adn interesting questions to ponder and the professor&#x27;s modules helped give answers to these questions. The assignment were not bad at all, but I just wished that they would also post a rubric. It took me a minute to understand how I should be writing my papers, and my grade&#x2F;stress initially suffered for it. But, fortunately, they were receptive to the feedback and informed students that the first grade would be dropped. Very underestanding teaching staff.</td>

It is a good introduction for first&ndash;years I think about what a college course is like and I think the topic is interesting without being too much work (really, hardly any work as they have it now). That being said these professors are going to change the course and they need to&ndash;&ndash;so whatever these comments say will likely become moot soon. On the pros, it is very little work outside of class, the assignments are one big essay project that is interesting if you pick a good topic, and you will walk away from lecture with new information that is often pretty interesting. That all being said, this course suffered from being in its first&ndash;year and that left many cons. For one thing, there is no cohesion. The essays do not relate to the lectures, the lecture modules only vaguely relate to each other, and sections relate to nothing, although Hagar tried her best. The profs, all of whom were interesting and clearly care a lot, need to refine what this class will be about and how to turn it into a class instead of what felt like a long lecture series with random assignments attached to it. If they can do that well, it can be one of Harvard&#x27;s most popular.</td>

The professors are all cordial and captivating, and a nice group camaraderie forms in section. In no other class of its size have I felt so connected to the teaching staff. Engagement was top tier. Don&#x27;t stress a bad grade on the first essay, but incorporate feedback into your future ones. Also, don&#x27;t stress the limited word count (it was 1000 for me). I did my best work and received my best grades when I disregarded it.</td>

The lectures are generally interesting and the class is a good precursor to the type of thinking that is required in the history department. That being said there isn&#x27;t set content like there is in other history classes so sometimes it is confusing to what you are supposed to take away from the lectures in the traditional sense. But they are interesting nonetheless! The class can feel disorganized sometimes, but honestly I believe that is only because this was the first year it was offered and that it will get smoother with more time. Section was the saving grace to this class, and made it feel a lot more structured and comprehensible as a whole.</td>

The assigments are not too challenging (especially if you take the class pass fail), but Professor Weld constantly talked to members of the class as if they were high school students. I remember an instance where one of the auditor&#x27;s phone rang during lecture (these auditors are like 80 years old btw) and she made a passive aggressive remark about everyone needing to have their phones off in lecture. I felt second hand embarrassment on her behalf and began to genuinely question if this was a college class I was in. Also, the professors don&#x27;t allow you to have your laptop out in class and they emailed multiple student&#x27;s resident deans about lecture attendance. Would not recommend unless maybe you&#x27;re a history concentrator looking for an easy class, because the workload is definitley easy.</td>

The Professors are brilliant people, the readings are interesting, they bring in current politics in a really interesting way, and they&#x27;re all engaging. My main critique of this course is that it should not be called &quot;HIST 10.&quot; While it is a great course, HIST 10 should be a course that is focused on teaching the facts of history rather than frameworks of understanding history.</td>

			<td class="TabularBody_LeftColumn" headers="comment-2_b0a85b6d-ea56-4908-9547-e7debb5f6c29">As the revived introductory history course, this class had so much potential, especially for the ⅓ of the class that were freshmen. This course marketed itself as “not your high school history class,” but in reality, this course could gain a lot by learning from high school history courses. My recommendations for this course primarily grapple with three issues: Size, interaction, and support.<br/><br/>History 10 claimed that “Lectures will be interactive, modeling debate and disagreement.” However, the very phrase “lectures will be interactive” is an oxymoron. There is countless research that lectures (passive learning) are ineffective for student learning (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;articles&#x2F;PMC7383800&#x2F; ; https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;articles&#x2F;PMC6765278&#x2F; ; https:&#x2F;&#x2F;files.eric.ed.gov&#x2F;fulltext&#x2F;EJ1435106.pdf ; https:&#x2F;&#x2F;direct.mit.edu&#x2F;edfp&#x2F;article&ndash;abstract&#x2F;13&#x2F;1&#x2F;97&#x2F;10281&#x2F;Mass&ndash;Instruction&ndash;or&ndash;Higher&ndash;Learning&ndash;The&ndash;Impact&ndash;of?redirectedFrom=fulltext ). Here are potential remedies:<br/>I. Say no to auditors<br/>It must be flattering that there are dozens of auditors attending lectures, but when they make up a silent half of the class, students can easily be under the impression that no one is participating.<br/><br/>II. Auditors increase the class size, making lecture even more “lecture&ndash;y.” <br/>Rather than “modeling debate and disagreement,” let students do the debate and disagreement.<br/>This class operated under the impression that watching the professors do things and interact was “teaching.” This, in fact, is not teaching. If all History 10 could offer was available to simply watch, then the course could simply be a YouTube series.<br/>The best learning and historical debate comes from actually interacting with the content. Simply reading assignments and writing about them in section is not active.<br/><br/>III. Connect modules better<br/>Try harder to connect them throughout, not just one singular “triangulation.” It would be much more impactful if we built connections throughout the modules, and especially if it was US doing the exploration, rather than simply listening to profs. lay it out.<br/><br/>IV. Get rid of lecture<br/>Before you immediately write this suggestion off as “too impossible&#x2F;difficult,” I would like to remind the professors that this course is meant to be a gateway, transformative history course. Instead of following the lead of centuries of higher education models and the countless massive lecture courses, this course SHOULD challenge the status quo.<br/><br/>Much of the issues with this course stem from the lecture structure. As shown in the Memory Module, active engagement with history, monuments, and museums is a far more effective form of memory—active memory. The same can be said to teaching history: If students themselves are not interacting with and piecing together history and its meanings, they do not gain anything from the history. If your goal is to “raise [students’] historical consciousness[es]” and “[teach] how to deploy historical thinking,” you have to have students actually apply them themselves. Historical thinking is inherently at odds with the lecture format—What historical questioning, curiosity, and revelation comes from listening to one person give their take on historical events? <br/><br/>Professors also complained about lack of student engagement in the course overall, and eventually banned electronics. I support the decision to remove electronics, but this will not fix the root cause. Look at any popular lecture course at Harvard. Econ 10: Students don’t even show up. CS 50: Students watch the lecture asynchronously or not at all. Justice, which is renowned for its unconventional interactive lecture style: Students are electronicless and still multitasking&#x2F;disengaged&#x2F;falling asleep (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.thecrimson.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;2024&#x2F;10&#x2F;11&#x2F;ruiz&ndash;michael&ndash;sandel&ndash;greatest&ndash;injustice&#x2F;). The lecture format is inherently unconducive to active engagement. Perhaps this format worked better centuries ago, with longer attention spans and greater need for distributing as much information as possible in a limited amount of time. But in our PRESENT, we have unprecedented effects from technological advances. While it is perfectly valid for the professors to be dissatisfied with such disengagement, it is also illogical to be stubborn and refuse to adapt to the conditions of the present. Students aren’t doing readings anymore? Make them. If the professors spend 150 minutes per week just talking, students have no incentive to do the reading. If students have to utilize the material, talk&#x2F;debate about it with their peers, and create their own conclusions, they’ll either have to do the readings or face embarrassment. Students aren’t engaging during lecture? If the professors spend 150 minutes per week just talking in a LECTURE, students have no incentive to speak up. If the course is smaller, more discussion&ndash;based, students can learn from each other and the professors.<br/><br/>Before you argue that “section provides a chance for smaller group discussion and deeper dives into the readings,” the ratio of time for lecture to section is 2.5;1. If students were already disengaged in lecture, having a section, where students just complete writing assignments or random vaguely related activities, will be just as ineffective.<br/><br/>Another effect of the lecture style and large class size was a complete lack of community. Learning from peer interaction is just as valuable as any other academic aspect. With the lecture style and large class size, it was near&ndash;impossible to even get to know anyone else in the class. Even in smaller sections, there was no community building or natural interactions.<br/>I. Say no to auditors<br/>It’s hard to turn and talk to someone when they are, in fact, not even a student.<br/><br/>II. Get rid of lecture<br/>The lecture is inherently ineffective for building any kind of class community. Look at the structure of Sever 113 itself. All students are facing the front, not each other. It’s difficult to speak up or share your real thoughts to a lecture hall full of strangers and silent old people.<br/><br/>III. Three professors<br/>There was so much opportunity in having THREE professors co&ndash;teach a course. Yet most of the time, it was just one professor teaching while the rest sat aside. Now imagine how that would look if three professors each took one&ndash;third of the class to discuss content during class blocks?<br/><br/>The final, and perhaps one of the most important, con of this course is the lack of support&#x2F;attention for students. History 10 claims to be “a new way to start&ndash;&ndash;or keep&ndash;&ndash;thinking about historical events, historical change, and historical context.”<br/>I. “Thinking about historical [fill in the blank]…”<br/>Almost 100% of the course time was dedicated to listening to the professors talk about their historical research. Section was solely centered around the module themes. While interaction with the modules is expected, the sheer amount of dedication to only looking at the professors’ research means there is no room for students to grow their historical thinking.<br/>The only place where students were encouraged to conduct their own historical research and thinking was in a 3&ndash;part essay series with a capstone project (another essay + three paragraphs). Each essay had immense vague and broad prompts, and lacked sufficient guidance. Each prompt was just a paragraph of questions, and extra information on the last two essays was only added after student complaints.<br/>There was no actual guidance on HOW to conduct historical research, WHAT kind of questions to ask, or WHERE to look for connections. Of course, there is no one formula to historical research, but there must be some advice that three renowned history professors can give.<br/>Additionally, all feedback was solely from the TFs (Hagar&#x2F;Kabl). While these TFs were friendly and interacted with students, the feedback left consisted of barely a paragraph, vague references, and reiterations of the prompt. There was no clear advice on how to improve.<br/><br/>II. Professors: Dedicate more time to your students.<br/>Having THREE professors had so much potential. The supposed instructor &ndash; student ratio would be quite good, but it was not used effectively. The three professors acted as if they were on a talk show&#x2F;podcast and really only talked to one another—hardly ever the actual students.<br/>Even during the coffee chat that was arranged to allow for more interaction with the professors, the three professors mainly spoke to each other, only taking questions from students.<br/>Recommendation: Become comfortable having casual conversations with students. Notice when you are prioritizing interacting with each other rather than us. <br/><br/>III. Say no to&#x2F;change the (memory) box<br/>Cool in concept, and perhaps is fine as a one&ndash;time activity during section, but if you continue it…<br/>The message about what items should be put in the box was extremely confusing: “the idea is not narrowly to include something that shows ‘what it’s like to be a Harvard student in 2024,’ or ‘what it’s like to be the specific person who you are’ (although these are fine).” Get rid of the “although these are fine.” Mixed messaging.<br/>We sat through ~ 10+ presentations of the SAME content. Could be cool to look at the items as a whole&#x2F;section once, but there’s no need to repeat the same thing over and over. Instead, consider dedicating that time to student presentations on their research projects.<br/><br/>IV. Let us cook.<br/>This class is marketed as a chance to improve our historical research and understanding, etc. The ONLY research&#x2F;exploration was our one, semester&ndash;long project. But in the end, the projects essentially went nowhere. A random capstone collection, graded by TFs, just like all the other assignments. Are the professors genuinely interested in our historical interests? We’ll never know.<br/>It would be much more engaging and student&ndash;centered to highlight student research (and to clarify, putting on a slideshow with ~60 slides with one photo to encapsulate three essays worth of research while everyone talks about unrelated topics does NOT count).<br/><br/>V. Please… please just give us more support…. Please just interact with us…….. Please just converse normally…… I beg you<br/>We were assigned essays about a subject of our interest…<br/>But when were we taught historical research methods? Any historical processes? When were we given advice or tips on how to improve our historical methods?<br/>Counterargument: Professors modeled historical research in the modules!<br/>In actuality, the professors simply gave summaries of their discoveries and different anecdotes, nothing really about how they went about searching for this information.<br/>Of course, there is no one&ndash;method&ndash;fits&ndash;all, but hearing advice and experiences from seasoned historians is helpful regardless<br/>Also, modeling is not teaching. Teaching is from guidance in hands&ndash;on experience, AKA, not in a lecture.<br/><br/>VI.Better feedback NOW!<br/>Dude. SO unclear what caused the grade we received. Legit no helpful feedback. Legit just 5 sentences and rephrasing the prompt again. There’s no way all the feedback for a 1000 word essay is a mere &lt;50 word comment.<br/><br/>VII. Get rid of the ego<br/>This is a bit more subjective&#x2F;based on the vibe, but these are genuine impressions I have from the class.<br/>It very much felt like the professors just wanted an audience to watch them. I understand that y’all are good friends and whatnot, but the entire class should not revolve around your dynamic. The question box, the Wednesday news recap really just felt like a talk show podcast type thing, where they weren’t interested in what we want to say, what we felt, what we wanted, etc. While they did make some changes mid&ndash;way through, which were good, the vibe was still off, and students still didn’t feel like contributing.<br/>Counterargument: Why don’t the students speak up if they want to be included?<br/>This is why community building in classes is so critical. Again, in a large lecture, with both classmates and random old people, it is actually quite difficult to build the courage to say what you truly think and break the silence.<br/><br/>**Something to reflect on: Who are you teaching this class for? Are you here for the students or yourselves? Is this a transformative, gateway co&ndash;taught history course or a chance for three professor friends to hang out?<br/><br/>There are plenty of counterarguments to my cases:<br/>I. Office hours exist for a reason<br/>Yes, a 1&ndash;2 hour block that exists once a week. You said it yourselves, Harvard students are now prioritizing extracurriculars beyond anything else. You can certainly complain about it, but there’s nothing you can do to change the entire culture of our campus. Adapt to it. <br/>Adding more office hours opportunities, promoting it more, etc.<br/>Or even making the class itself more interactive (lecture → seminar)<br/><br/>II. Lectures are a pillar of higher education<br/>This is a fact that has not changed in decades of higher education. However, times are changing. The average attention span has become shorter and shorter. New research on better teaching pedagogy challenges lecture style. Technology is addictive, and lectures are the best suited place for getting off track (your job is literally to sit there). Again, you’ve all recognized the changing present. It’s logical to try and adapt to it.<br/><br/>III. But changing to seminar would cap enrollment<br/>True, but perhaps this can be a good thing. You get rid of auditors and many students who are really only in the class for a GEM (easy class). Perhaps you’ll have to put more effort into a seminar style course, but that also means students will have to reciprocate. <br/>Tighter&ndash;knit community, THREE freaking professors to go around<br/><br/>IV. These are such demanding asks<br/>I know. But I also believe in the power and potential of history. If this class is to be the gateway, the representative course of Harvard History, shouldn’t it be a lot? Shouldn’t it challenge the status quo? Shouldn’t it be interactive? Shouldn’t it be a place of both community and intellectual growth? Shouldn’t it be full of risk&ndash;taking?<br/>You will get out of this course what you put into it. Again, who, exactly, are you teaching this class for?<br/><br/>TL;DR: Unless you are a die&ndash;hard Jill Lepore super&ndash;fan or this class goes through SERIOUS structural changes, I very strongly do not recommend taking this course.</td>

The assignments are a bit self&ndash;instructed and independent but expect the style of the course to change, compared to when I took it, because the course is still being workshopped.</td>

Great in all areas, I especially loved that this taught by 3 renowned historians and they each present what the &quot;History of the Present&quot; means to them. It&#x27;s the type of course where you can just sit there and truly absorb the content, you don&#x27;t need to take thorough notes as long as you pay attention. I also loved how every lecture began with answering questions about recent events&#x2F;news, it was fascinating to hear from the professors and hear their opinions&#x2F;takes on several matters. I also really enjoyed the section component of the course, it was interactive (a lot of cool in&ndash;section activities) and easy to participate. I would strongly encourage you to take this class even if you are even remotely interested in history, it isn&#x27;t dense like ordinary history classes but you still get a ton out of it!</td>

			<td class="TabularBody_LeftColumn" headers="comment-2_b0a85b6d-ea56-4908-9547-e7debb5f6c29">This class is not difficult if you read the assignment guidelines carefully and go to office hours. In fall 2024 it was brand new, so they were still working on it and it probably has improved a great deal. The lectures and readings had nothing to do—I mean, literally nothing—with the writing assignments, so the only thing making lecture and even section required was the 30% participation grade. I admit that I grew frustrated with the course by the end of November for its lack of a concrete self&ndash;identity and coherent purpose. In that way it&#x27;s a lot like Hum 10, only with a lot less reading and writing and much less complexity.</td>
