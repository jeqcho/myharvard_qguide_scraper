It made me decide that I want to study economics. Even though you have a strong background in economics, I think it is definitely worth taking it: where else will you find one of the best behavioral economists in the world and the former Obama chief economics advisor teach you the rules of supply and demand? And honestly, Ec10 is much more than that. Econ APs cover just a small fraction of what you will study in Ec10: new breakthroughs in behavioral economics, from David&#x27;s side, and policymaking strategies, from Jason&#x27;s side, make Ec10 a unique intro course to economics. David (Martin) is also an excellent teacher, always able to clarify what was not 100% clear in class. Exams are fair: if you spend time on the practice tests there is no doubt you will do vey well in the actual tests. Psets are very useful, in my opinion the best way to learn the content. Sections of course depend on what TF you get, but overall they are all super prepared and willing to help at OH.</td>

As someone who has never taken economics of any sort before, I really enjoyed the lectures and found them interesting. Also, this may be the last economics course I take (after Ec10B), and I feel as though I have a solid foundation for the future. The readings, problem sets, and midterm exam were all reasonable and helped cement my understanding. It&#x27;s also a lot of fun taking this course as a first&ndash;year, since the majority of the first&ndash;year class takes it with you.</td>

The course has lots of supports but the explanations of topics are not close to adequate. I&#x27;d recommend doing URP, although it didn&#x27;t help my grade at all, it can definitely help you if you are on the border of one grade then it would be very helpful. I will never take another economics class again, the content was not that interesting, lectures were not that helpful (not that much talk of the concepts and primarily just applications which don&#x27;t help in the slightest with exams),  psets were terrible because they required you to just learn stuff that was never discussed in lectures, textbook, or section.  If I could go back in time then I would tell myself to never take this class and I wouldn&#x27;t recommend anybody take this course if they don&#x27;t already have some experience in economics.</td>

Yes, it&#x27;s a classic Harvard course, but it&#x27;s not magical. They generally skim over a HUGE amount of content (each lecture could probably have an entire course devoted to it) and while they do their best to incorporate some nuance, it wasn&#x27;t really enough to leave me satisfied. I think it can be a pretty good indicator of whether you want to study econ further, but also might not be indicative of what the coursework for an econ major will look like.</td>

The beginning is supply and demand and I am more of a fan of macro but the course still had a lot to offer and it was interesting. As for the pset, you could just get it done during office hours but then you won&#x27;t learn because the answers are given to you basically. Then you will struggle a lot during the midterm and final and studying for that is tough if you haven&#x27;t been doing the pset yourself. Also, the lectures can be watched online so need to really worry if you simultaneously enroll, you will. be okay.</td>

I felt that I was finally able to understand some confusing topics when I was reviewing for the final exam and attending review sessions and reading answer key explanations. My section was not really helpful, but David Martin (the head TF) records his sections and they are much clearer.<br/><br/>Definitely do take this class even if you have already taken AP Economics as this class brings in new material and applications into economics that is not covered in AP. Also, the AP class covers a lot of smaller topics that Ec 10a doesn&#x27;t, so this class allows you to see which topics in economics that Harvard focuses on.</td>

This class oversimplifies nearly every single topic it discusses, which made things a little frustrating for me as I don&#x27;t like when I&#x27;m faced with a &quot;black box&quot; and just expected to believe a result.  Be careful with the class &ndash; similar to you, I may have not invested the time I needed to at the beginning (I completely missed the first lecture, showed up to the second and decided to skip out just looking over the lecture slides). In retrospect, this was a very dumb idea on my part. <br/><br/>For the assessment portion of the class, problem sets were fine, generally approachable. I wouldn&#x27;t worry about the course engagement or debate or extraneous categories of grading, just show up to section &ndash; instead, the place where this class gets you is the exams. Both the midterm and final factor to 60% of your final grade, so at the end of the day you will be tested more on multiple choice skills than actual economics. <br/><br/>Before the midterm, I just did the practice exams sort of willy&ndash;nilly and didn&#x27;t even make a cheat sheet since I figured I would know the content. Turns out I didn&#x27;t! But after the midterm, I really got my stuff together and showed up to lectures, did readings, etc. I was lucky for finals season in that I only was studying for 2 finals (though they were both scheduled the first day possible), so I put in a lot of time making sure every answer I put on a practice test would be the right one. If you put in the work, it is 100% possible to do well in the class. I was proud of my final grade in the class, even though I don&#x27;t now consider myself an economics person. Best of luck to you as you decide on classes!</td>

When I was deciding whether to take this course, I read a lot of q reports saying that this class is incredibly easy if you took AP Micro and Macro and got 5s. So, I enrolled in this course expecting to build upon my already strong econ foundation set by the AP classes, and did not expect the struggle that ensued. This class includes a LOT more information beyond AP Micro, and does not present the content that does overlap in the same way. In fact, it might have been better to not have had any experience at all because I felt like I had to re&ndash;learn content in accordance with the way this course wanted it. Furthermore, the course includes a lot of information tightly packed into lecture and it is expected that you will have essentially memorized this lecture material because you will be ruthlessly tested on it in midterm and final. The lectures often discuss case studies and long lists of information, thus requiring memorization of these facts in order to do well on the exams. This is very frustrating because I thought the course would emphasize problem&ndash;solving principle rather than memorizing the tiniest, most obscure, and confusing components of lecture. Also, because the class does not require attendance, you will probably not go unless you have insane self&ndash;discipline (even if you thought you did in high school, everything changes in college). If you know you are an in&ndash;person learner and you don&#x27;t go to class, it can be a big problem to try and learn the course material. Additionally, it is hard to stay up to date with lecture recordings since there are 2 per week, and you could end up cramming every single lecture in reading period before the final. This seems like an absurd reality compared to a very self&ndash;disciplined high school life, but it is very possible that this will happen (trust me), and if that is a frightening thought then don&#x27;t take this class because it enables this. The class can also be so unengaging at times that it is hard to find the motivation to want to go to lecture. A lot of office hours are hosted by TFs where they go over the PSETs &#x2F; answers (shoutout to Jack Kelly, his office hours saved me every week!!!). These office hours mean that you don&#x27;t need to watch the lectures and can instead rely on going to these office hours to get the PSETs done. While this feels very convenient in the moment and means that you can get by with doing max 4 hours of work per week, it is very difficult to cram all the material you know before finals and this tactic can end up hurting big time in the long run. Thus, this class teaches you a lot, but not about economics. Rather, it teaches you what kind of student you are, how you manage your time best, how you learn, and how easy it is to fall behind in college courses. Even if every peer around you is taking this course, do NOT feel pressured to take it as well because you think you will be &quot;missing out&quot; on this iconic course. While the professors and their work are very cool, it does not change the fact that the class itself is very difficult to keep up with and stay engaged. It is also not easy to get by and get a good grade.</td>

I&#x27;ve met so many new friends and generally other freshmen by taking this course, and I also think it fostered a stronger economic intuition that I&#x27;m going to carry with me for my future Economics courses. <br/>My two pieces of advice:<br/>1. Go to all the URP! It&#x27;s looking like this course won&#x27;t have any curve this year, so doing the URP will provide a significant grade boost (2%!) that gives you SO much more cushion even if you&#x27;re already relatively strong at economics. <br/>2. Lock in for the midterms and final: I thought that I could get away with studying less for the midterm, but I definitely think it&#x27;s worth doing all of the practice exams AND the past exams they give you (there are some problems in the past exams that they don&#x27;t include in the practice ones that I think are worth doing). Additionally, make sure to review the MyLab questions since they&#x27;ll also come up on the exam! The problem sets are less important &ndash;&ndash; just understand the general idea of each one.</td>

This might sound like terrible advice, but I think that for very busy people this can help a lot. Lectures are great and essentially make up the entirety of what you learn in this class. They are crucial. But they are all professionally recorded and posted immediately after class where you can watch them at 2x speed. This saved me SO MUCH time and also I got way more out of lectures because I could watch them when I actually was motivated to and could focus way better. The few times I attended lecture in person, I found I got less out of it than watching them on my own. I also would use the time that I wasn&#x27;t going to lecture to finish other work or sleep, and there was just much more freedom with my time. I have to stress that if you do follow this advice, you MUST stay on top of watching the lectures or you will fall behind. They are the only necessary part of this course in my opinion. Also keep in mind this advice is specific to my experience and won&#x27;t work for everyone.<br/>&ndash; DON&#x27;T DO THE READINGS TRUST ME. I spent the first month of this course both watching lectures and reading the assigned chapters. After a month I realized the readings were a waste of time. They cover the exact same things in lecture with the same examples and it is usually much easier to understand when they explain it during lecture. If you are stuck on a topic or if the readings cover something that is specifically not in lecture (this only happened like once or twice and they tell you), then you should probably do the readings. But trust me, if you are a busy person that has to juggle a lot of things, the lectures will almost always be enough.<br/>&ndash; PRACTICE TESTS, PRACTICE TESTS, PRACTICE TESTS. Do all the practice tests before the midterm and final, and I guarantee you will get an A. They recycle half of the questions every year, and I am not joking when I say the EXACT same questions on some of the practice tests will show up on exams. The best practice exams to do are the ones from the previous year because they will be the most similar.<br/>&ndash; Do the unit review program. It&#x27;s a free 2% extra for your final grade, which is a lot. I regret not doing it because it put more pressure on the final.<br/>&ndash; SHOULD YOU TAKE IT? This class is a great introduction to economics. But that&#x27;s what it is, an introduction. The concepts are pretty trivial and will feel like common sense a lot of the time. As someone with no econ background, it felt too slow sometimes. Although, if you are not good with numbers or analytical thinking some concepts can be confusing. I&#x27;ve been told that it&#x27;s not a good idea to skip to 1010a, but if you have an econ background, just know this class will be very easy. Great intro though regardless of skill and I think everyone should take it!</td>

The problem sets are applicable to the exams, which makes them a valuable learning tool. Also, there are plenty of review sessions and office hours to help clarify difficult concepts. The professors are very professional, and the guest speakers (Roland Fryer in particular) added a lot of value to the course by discussing real&ndash;world topics like inequality, climate change, and pollution. These examples really helped me connect economic theory with current global issues.<br/><br/>I will say, the real exams were maybe a bit more challenging than the practice tests, but were still a great tool to prepare. The course also seems to have a slight liberal bias when discussing certain topics like inequality and climate change, which could be a drawback for those who prefer a more neutral perspective. Another downside is the online textbook, which costs around $55. While it&#x27;s a nice resource, it&#x27;s not essential to doing well in the course, so it&#x27;s a bit of an unnecessary expense.<br/><br/>My advice would be to definitely participate in the URP for extra credit—it’s a great way to clarify any concepts you&#x27;re struggling with and gives you free points. Pay attention in both the lecture and the section, as that&#x27;s where the majority of the material is covered. Also, make sure to utilize all the resources available, including office hours, review sessions, and practice tests and you should be fine to get a great grade and learn introductory microeconomics.</td>

Psets are worth 25% of your grade and this is an easy way to help you get that A at the end!<br/><br/>&ndash; Finally, PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE do the Unit Review Programs. These are easy 2% extra credit bonuses on your final grade! This is what got me my A (I think). It literally could be the difference between an A and an A&ndash;, so please please please go. It&#x27;s like one hour out of your week, every two weeks. Just go and get your extra credit!</td>
