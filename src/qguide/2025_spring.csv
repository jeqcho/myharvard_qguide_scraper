A lot of credit here to the teaching team –– the class was originally supposed to be a small seminar–style class, but then they had to adapt when 50 people registered.  Having listened to student feedback, they split the class in two each week with each of them alternating which half of the class they would lead in the original seminar discussion.In another example of the good balances the class struck, the readings generally skewed academic, but the assignments allowed you to go out into the real world and apply what we learned in class –– those who were interested could do an ethnography and an art project in lieu of traditional academic papers.I know Marty is an HMS professor, but I really hope she comes back for another course –– and I would be the first in line to sign up!

I'm not entirely sure if she will be here again, but if you ever encounter her, you should take a class with her or just chat. She is very well–versed in the topic of China and Afro–China, with a particular focus on real estate, urban space, construction, and infrastructure. She structures the classroom so that students can speak more without losing sight of what's important in the discussions. She makes herself available to students, even though she's incredibly busy with her own writing. I wish we had met more times to chat. The book review is nothing complicated and straightforward. Dr. Tamburo guides you through how to write a proper book review. The final paper is a little tricky, since it's an anthropological paper that you need to write without going to the field, quite counter–intuitive at times because you'd usually make arguments based on ethnographic evidence. For people who are using this paper as a pre–fieldwork paper, it might be a bit of a struggle if the topic of your research is not a heavily researched topic. I'd have really appreciated it if we could have the choice between a precis+lit review and an argumentative paper.

Unfortunately, as it is being currently run under Weiwei, it will be a massive, massive disappointment unless something changes. A few years ago, the projects in this class would be exciting and from a number of different partners, including companies like Microsoft. This semester, unfortunately, almost every single project was healthcare related, because that is Weiwei's work.  It was quite clear that many of these partners had no interest in the class, and simply did not care about the projects. Many project teams that I spoke to did not receive data and necessary information from the partners until almost the end of the semester; this was also true for my team's project. There was a general sense of complete disengagement from the partners. The class was also poorly organized – there was hardly any context about assignments, and TFs / project mentors themselves did not know anything about the assignments and deadlines. We were supposed to have presentations and exciting guest lectures from industry partners, but not even a single one ever happened. Weiwei is also just so unresponsive – she simply didn't show up to our group's meetings  twice (and didn't even tell us that she wouldn't be coming). There was simply no communication about most things – we were not even told about the exact timings and details of the poster session until the day of the session. Ironically enough, Weiwei and the TFs did not even show up to our poster session – we stood there for 3 hours presenting to random people passing by. In our weekly check–ins with her, it was clear that Weiwei had no idea what our project was about and where it was headed, which meant that we never got any concrete advice or sense of direction from her. I know, of course, that the capstone is meant to be a class where you own a lot of the decisions regarding the project and are expected to do things independently. But the problem was that we had a completely unresponsive partner and a completely unresponsive instructor in Weiwei, who simply didn't do anything. Not to mention that we didn't even have data to work with for most of the semester. Overall, I think that this class under Weiwei is a complete mess. The CSE department really needs to figure this stuff out and make sure that this doesn't happen in the future. MIT has a similar capstone project, and I've heard from their students that that class is one of the highlights of their MIT experience. It is a shame that the Harvard version is anything but that. To be fair to Weiwei, she is extremely smart and a wonderful lecturer. And I'm sure that she is also really busy with other things. But that doesn't mean that the capstone project (which is described as a 'mini thesis' for our program) can be relegated to being an afterthought by the instructor. I really hope that the department finds a way to make this course better.",0.9626,Be prepared to be confused about the deliverables and requirements,-0.1027,,0.0

If you're an AM concentrator and you're looking for a class where you can learn without being overworked and stressed out with incredibly hard PSETs and exams, this class is for you. Each week there's a PSET/lab, which is can be time–consuming but the problems themselves aren't terribly hard IF you have experience with python. This class says no coding experience is required, but I think they aren't revealing how dependent the work in the class is with coding. I was appreciative of my experience with Python (cs32). Not that you'll fail without it, but you'd likely need to go to office hours, the optional Friday sections, and consult online sources, so this class might not be as stress–free then. But the class meets 2x a week, and attendance is only mandatory everytime for the presentation and lab days, and some random time when he takes attendance during lecture days. However, after the first month of class, you truly don't know when attendance will be taken (even during ""mandatory"" days). I skipped a lecture class one day to study for an exam, and he happened to take attendance that day, so my grade when down. This was late March, and it was the last time he took attendance. So in total he took attendance 10x for the semester, and even though I didn't miss a class after that, my attendance grade was still a 90. Not to say he was wrong for that, but just to say, be careful because attendance it isn't very routine.As far as the material, this class was a cool intro to AM, but I wish the classes were more rooted in the code since the PSETs and Lab were so reliant on it. The small taste of the conceptual parts of different AM topics were hard to follow at times. But that's no reason not to take this class! You totally should! You'll likely get a good grade and learn some cool applications, so I def recommend for AM concentrators!",0.9748,"Lectures for this class are not very engaging, I won't lie. I found myself easily checking emails + doing other class work instead. However, I just ended up with a bad feeling that I didn't learn as much as I could and I wouldn't recommend that. Maybe try your very best to stay engaged, though its HARD to do so because its so BORING at times.

Additionally, this course is hard but the teaching staff is awesome and makes it super rewarding. Margo and the teaching staff are INCREDIBLE, which is extremely rare to come by and ultimately why I would recommend this course to AM majors. Margo LISTENS to her students (she doesn't have this attitude like ""I taught it you should know it immediately""). She always stops after covering concepts to get a vibe check on how the class feels about a certain topic and if she needs to go more in depth. She also genuinely cares a lot about her students and wants them to succeed. Midway through the course I was struggling quite a bit but I met with Margo and she calmed me down a ton. As in any course, some lectures are more dry than others and sometimes it's hard to get yourself to class but seeing Margo made me excited and motivated to go everyday. The teaching staff will differ every year but this year they were AWESOME. I used the Ed stem a lot, asking a bunch of questions about the homework, midterms, etc., and they were always answered in a timely manner by a TF or Margo.Overall, while this course was a grind I would certainly recommend it for anyone who is interested in math, willing to commit some time, and seeks a rewarding experience taught by awesome staff.",0.9981,"Simply put, this course is not structured in a way that values students' time. The problem sets are outrageously long (my last problem set submission was 35 pages long) and not particularly challenging, taking longer to typeset appropriately than to solve. The grading is harsh, and the TFs look for any reason to take off credit on problems as opposed to any reason to give you credit like they do in other class. The problem sets after the horrible slog are just 15% of your grade which is enough that you have to do them but not enough that it really matters that you do well on them. Please get rid of the completion problems, quite frankly they're a waste of time for everyone and the flood of them makes the problem sets take 15–20 hours to do and write up. Also student choice being a second problem set every other week simply feels like more busywork in a class that's already long hours with little substance. 9am three days a week seems to suit no one except for Margo, and this combined with the occasional unsolvable integral on the midterm gives us the impression as students that the teaching staff don't think about us much at all.",-0.893,,0.0

However, this comes with the benefit that AP 50a/b does NOT contain exams, and only grades you on the TEAM component of assignments. As a result, you have a chance to correct all of your work before submitting it to be evaluated. Additionally, if there are still mistakes, you have the chance to do markups to correct it, ensuring that you perform well in the class.Overall, the reality is that AP50a/b will GUARANTEE you an A if you submit your work on time. The structure is outlined very early in the course, and the requirements are extremely straightforward. However, you must stay on track for all assignment and compete EVERYTHING on time. If you fall behind and either miss ONE assignment or have ONE dissatisfactory grade (and fail to make it up in a reasonable amount of time), it will automatically bump you down a full letter grade. However, as long as you complete all assignments on time and follow the course structure perfectly, there is no way you can go wrong.Notably, the learning atmosphere within AP50b remains one of the course’s biggest weaknesses, especially as it relates to specific members of the teaching team. While a majority of the teaching staff are supportive and work hard to create an encouraging atmosphere, there are very evident exceptions to this. Instead, the actions of some members of the teaching team continue to intimidate and discourage students, leading to the creation of an extremely toxic environment that fails to promote learning. One of the course heads, Robert Haussman, is the most unsupportive individual in the entire class. Although he seems to have a calm and encouraging personality when you first meet him, this is merely a facade. When students ask questions on Slack or in–person, he often responds in the most passive aggressive tone. For example, when a student asked about the progress of grade snapshots (a grade preview that the teaching staff typically provide at multiple time points throughout the semester to keep students on track), he chose to respond that he did not have sufficient time to fulfill this and told the student to go calculate it themselves, as the sheet to do so has “been there all year” long. This highlights his complete disregard of the needs of students and decision to blame students for a shortcoming of his own. Then, during check–ins, his discouraging personality is even more evident, with Robert often staying with groups for 30+ minutes on something that should realistically only take 10–15 minutes maximum. Beyond the questions asked within the assignment, he chooses to ask students follow–up after follow–up. While this would normally be acceptable (especially if used to try and further student understanding), he often becomes extremely disapproving and notably disgruntled when students have the smallest ounce of confusion. Having an instructor like this not only FAILS to create a helpful environment that facilitates student engagement and learning, but also TURNS STUDENTS AWAY from asking for help when they need it. Looking forward, this is an area that needs significant improvement, or AP50 will continue failing to meet the needs of its students. Unfortunately, this issue also persists with some of the course TFs. One TF in particular, Ri Dresser, is very similar to Robert and also leads to the creation of an unsupportive and toxic atmosphere in class. As one of the TFs that regularly does check–ins, they are known throughout the class as being one of the harshest graders, often giving VERY low scores to students for making simple mistakes. For context, check–ins are graded between 0–3, with 0 indicating no effort (or not completing the assignment), 1 indicating minimal effort, 2 indicating satisfactory work and effort (even if some of the work is wrong), and 3 indicating work that extends beyond the expectations of the class. With this in mind, 2 is the “normal” score that students should expect to receive as long as they present their work in a reasonable manner. However, Ri has a tendency to give VERY low scores, ranging from 1.3 to 0.8 to even 0.5, despite there being no valid reason for doing so. In fact, there are days where Ri was shown to give consecutive “failing” scores ranging between 0.5–0.8 to SEVERAL groups back to back, being the ONLY TF to do so. Beyond just the grading, Ri is also very unapproachable due to their attitude. In class, Ri oftentimes grips their head in agony and sighs loudly when students indicate confusion. In effect, this makes students extremely uncomfortable and creates an environment that appears to punish making mistakes (or being unsure about something), as opposed to encouraging learning and individual growth. Similar to the note above about Robert, the fact that members of the teaching staff act in this manner completely TURNS AWAY students from being passionate and wanting to learn physics. Instead, all it causes is students purposely trying to avoid these members of the teaching staff, knowing that asking them for help will only lead to further judgement and frustration. Despite my aforementioned complaints about AP50b, credit is due where credit is deserved – the saving grace for this course and silver lining amidst tons of issues is Kelly Miller, one of the new course heads. This semester, Kelly was introduced as one of the new instructors and began taking over the AP50 series. She will also be the primary course head going forward for both AP50a/b. As an instructor, Kelly is one of the most SUPPORTIVE individuals I have ever met, oftentimes trying to uplift students and encourage them to continue achieving higher. When students have questions, she acknowledges their needs and works to improve their understanding with compassion. As students bring up points of frustration with the class, she remains extremely receptive (and RESPONSIVE) to feedback, piloting new initiatives to try and fix the weak points of the course. Lastly, Kelly is just extremely positive – always seeming genuinely PASSIONATE about the course and as if she wants to see her students thrive. Knowing that Kelly will be permanently taking over the course gives me hope that AP50 will change going forward, with the intent of better supporting the needs of students. As a whole, Kelly should be seen as a role model to AP50 teaching staff on what a genuinely outstanding instructor looks like!Similarly positive things can also be said about the following TFs, who have gone above and beyond to make the class an enjoyable and learning class environment: Tayna Camargo, Alex Buzali, Soy Choy, and Anna Luong. Thank you to each of these amazing individuals for making AP50b more tolerable, and a better learning environment (despite the aforementioned flaws).With this in mind, I think AP50a/b is a great option if you are looking to ensure a good grade in physics and can accept the faults of the course. However, go in with a realistic expectation on the time needed to complete assignments, and an understanding on some of the weak points of the course overall. To any student choosing between PS 2/3 and AP 50a/b, good luck – I wish you the best of luck. Physics is a lot regardless of which course you choose, but work hard and you will get through it.",0.9986,"Be very careful taking this class. if you are a person who is not good with deadlines or a person who THINKS they are good at deadlines, think very critically about enrolling. I thought I was good at deadlines but realized that was for normal classes with normal types of deadlines and workflow. This class is insane and something is due EVERY SINGLE DAY. If you miss one thing you are at risk of your grade dropping an entire letter grade. The teaching staff does not teach nor provide any sort of teaching, guidance, or advice going into the various modules. They are also overly strict about meeting specifications in order to receive a particular grade.  It is really unfortunate that most students leave this course having learned nothing, being unclear about what they did or why, because there is no guidance from staff. If you actually want to learn physics, please take PS2/3/12 etc. I did not care to actually learn so I took it, but if I wanted to learn things I'd be very disappointed with this class.",-0.9692,,0.0

This semester we made many normal prints, like just artwork on the wall, but also other crazier stuff like a lamp that hung from the ceiling, a supermarket shelf, many sculptures, and even a huge tree with prints hanging off the branches. You get so much freedom (and support!) to explore whatever you want to do. Just be realistic and don't undertake an insane project that you'll have to rush to finish the day before critique.You learn a lot about silkscreening (obviously), and get to experiment with different techniques like CMYK or mixing colors on the screen itself, but a big part of what I took away from this class was the critique after each project. We all gather around one artwork at a time, hear the student explain their thought process or the meaning behind the piece, and then give our thoughts, compliments, and constructive criticism – what could have been improved, what could be changed to make the piece even better.All–in–all, I recommend this class.

It's very chill and during class we always talked shortly at the start then began getting into painting on our own with earpods in.  Definitely a great break from math and structured academia where you can enjoy creativity, perception, and the other side of you brain (all areas that are rarely touched if you are a hands on econ/CS/math person). I wasn't the only one. One of our best painters was Pre Med Track. Definitely the best and most rewarding way to take a class if you are a creative person and dont want to take a lame ahh gened and write a meaningless 10 paper paper. Atleast here, you actually train an untouched side of your brain, have fun, low stakes/workload, AND have artwork to take home at the end of the semester.

So one class will be dedicated to learned how to use Adobe After Effects, and the exercise that week will be to create a short (maybe 30 second?) long video with some of the stuff you learned. You're not graded on how good the thing you made is, just the fact that you learned how to use anything at all. It's literally the perfect environment for learning because you're encouraged to just mess around.The second–ish half (or maybe last third? time has all muddled up for me now) of the semester is dedicated to the final project.

After each week you will have ended up learning a bunch of new techniques and you'll have so many new tools at your disposal, that you can start pitching and idea for a final project. Some people made films that were 2–3 minutes long, and others under a minute. Every single student, with or without prior art experience, made amazing works and I'm so glad to have been able to see them all (and see them being made!)There are weekly screenings every Friday from 12pm–2pm (unless the schedule changes, but it's roughly 2 hours) where we watch a bunch of short animations. Just so so cool. If you can't go, you can make it up by watching them on your own time and submitting your thoughts on each one, but I can't recommend enough to show up in person because 1. you won't have to write anything, and 2. the in–person discussions are just so great.Lastly, the 4–hour long class can seem daunting, but it really does fly by. We take breaks half–way through (I use mine to get lunch lol) and plus it's not 4 hours of intense work, you're mostly sitting around comfortably working on your animation or messing around with puppets or clay.I've learned so much from this class from specific skills to how animation works as a process in general. I feel so much more prepared to animate more in the future, and will be taking the intermediate class too next semester!Ruth is AMAZING, and so is Michael!! They are so kind, patient and knowledgeable and it was just an honor to have been able to learn so much from them. I had a hard time with my final project because I'm a perfectionist, completely overestimated how much I could get done in the time I had AND started way too late (horrible combo), but Ruth and Michael helped me so much throughout the process. They really guided me on how to make my animation better, what to cut, and just generally how to go about it. I seriously cannot recommend enough that you take this class. Even if you're not an AFVS concentrator, you'll have such a fun time taking this as an elective and you'll be able to say you made animations during college lol!ONCE MORE TAKE THIS CLASS IT'S AWESOME !!!!",0.9951,,0.0,,0.0

Both Tala and Madison are incredibly kind and passionate about their work. If you’re interested or curious about filmmaking in any capacity (fiction or not) definitely enroll in this course. You learn the basic fundamentals of cinematography, sound, editing, and color correction while also learning how to best execute the story you want to tell. I’d say go into the class having an open mind and some ideas of what film you want to make.

Professor Johnson and the teaching staff are absolutely excellent. The format of the class is ""flipped"" and involves a lot of independent work in group settings through problems, usually after brief lectures by Professor Johnson to start you off and introduce a concept. Personally, since I learn best by doing, this was an extremely effective way to learn. It was so much fun to get to know and learn from and work with the other people in our group, and we formed a close bond over the semester. Also, working in groups to try to figure out ways to tackle these challenging problems is legitimately a really good way to learn. Homeworks were very reasonable on Professor Johnson's part and you always feel very supported throughout the class. I thought the labs were a little bit frustrating, mainly because it felt like we didn't have enough background to write the level of depth needed for the reports. Nonetheless, the night lab where you try to observe an eclipsing binary on the Clay Telescope is REALLY COOL. The midterm exam is a group midterm where you have to explain class concepts to a random person who knows nothing about astrophysics. This is an AMAZING exam format. It really forces you to go back through all the material and make sure you fundamentally understand astrophysical concepts, so you can't get away with just knowing how to use equations. This is not something that we do nearly enough of at Harvard, and I really appreciate Professor Johnson's approach to learning. Whether you are an astro concentrator (and have no choice) or just interested in astrophysics, I strongly recommend this class, and specifically taking it with Professor Johnson!",0.9901,"This class partially killed my love for astronomy. The class was solely based on these worksheets that my group always got behind on, because it was riddled with material never covered in class, where we'd have to jump to crazy conclusions to figure out.

Even worse were the labs, complete disorganized messes and the lab reports were horrible. So many things on the lab reports were very complex or not even gone over properly or at all during the lab section, and the teaching staff was extra inaccessible when so many people needed help with the lab reports. I don't think I've ever been so disappointed in something I've submitted for a class than my second lab report.

Richard is an amazing professor– he is incredibly smart, very friendly, easily accessible outside of class, and welcomes input. You will learn a lot in this class from him. The Head TF, Paul, was also super knowledgeable and a very chill and approachable guy, so it made seeking clarification accessible and easy.2. The class curve is very generous. We had extra credit on nearly all of the in–class quizzes, and the grading was quite chill on all of the assignments overall. If you do every assignment and just a little bit of review each week before the quizzes (not more than 3 –4 hours a week), you should easily be in the A range.3. You cover a lot of very interesting material, but in an intuitive and low–pressure environment. I took this class concurrently with Chem 40 (which is usually a prereq for this class) and I wish I had just used this class to fulfill my Inorganic requirement. The first 1/4 of the class is a speedrun of Chem 40 content going slightly more in depth into everything; the next 2/4 is an overview of all the elementary steps of organometallic chemistry followed by an in–depth exploration of the mechanisms of each; and finally, the last 1/4 is applying this new knowledge to learn new reactions. You will learn a lot in this class, but it will not be stressful because of the above reasons.TL;DR: Overall, this is an awesome class that I would highly recommend anyone studying Chemistry take when it is available. It is everything you could want in a class– interesting material, awesome professor and teaching staff, not too much work per week (3–4 hours), and a generous curve.

As someone who was taking 6 classes during the semester, I didn't put that much time in this class, but I still came out with a rudimentary understanding of chemistry and was not incredibly stressed. I think it is only stressful if you do things last minute. I have always started pset part I, the online portion, about 3 hrs before it's due. A 90% gives you full credit, so don't stress about making things perfect. There is a point of diminishing returns. Here is my work flow if you wish to have an understanding of the weekly workload: I start part II on Saturdays. I don't do anything before then. I go to the 2 hrs office hours and then the additional office hours with Joe, who won't be on the teaching staff next year, but I complete the most of the pset on Saturday. I leave Sunday and Monday for sometimes when the pset is longer than usual. This class really isn't supposed to be rocket science, and people that say it is so, they just want to be perfect, and you can't always have that. Find other things worth your time to be stressed about. You don't have to be perfect to get an A. There are also plenty of opportunities to savage your pset and lab scores. Lectures are fun.

There are some unique examples that may benefit you on the exams. You get a cheat sheet front and back for each exam, so fill it up with things that she says. My main gripe about this class is the wacky lab schedule. Like, this is genuinely my only issue with this class. It was genuinely so odd how there was an A  and B group. But then it wasn't consistent? So then what was the point? The idea was that group A students go first, then group B goes the next week. But sometimes, we had both groups going each week. Friday's section is the last to go for one lab, but for the next lab topic, they somehow become the first class to go. And then tell me why the prelab for the next lab is due before the lab report for the current lab. I think the Friday's lab sections got screwed over the most this semester. And then for the weeks that Friday's group goes last, every single group, no matter if you were monday's lab from the week before or friday's lab, everyone had the same due date. That's simply not fair for people who only had the weekend to put together the lab report versus someone who has the whole week.",0.9981,"Beginning before the semester started, I was surprised at how disorganized the course felt. Before the first lecture on the first day of classes, we already needed to watch a lecture, scan and submit a few pages of work, and complete Pset 0 Part 2 (but not part 1 yet). If I had not checked canvas in the middle of January, a week before classes started, I would have already been several hours behind on the first day. This pattern continued throughout the semester, with several things being due each week, all at different times. At the beginning, the head TF explained that many people fall behind in this course, so they split each assignment up into sub–parts with multiple checkpoints per week, BUT this method actually had the reverse effect by making me more anxious about all the little due dates. For example, there is a Pset Part 1, Pset Part 2, Pre–lab, and Lab Report due each week but on four different days (and across Canvas, Gradescope, and EdX platforms), so I needed to re–allocate my time each week depending on which of those assignments were due when. What's a simple solution to the scheduling problem? Create a class Gcal! Great idea. This course had a class Gcal that we were required to subscribe to as part of Pset 0 Part 2. HOWEVER, the Gcal was never updated and often contained outdated or flat–out incorrect information about due dates. Roughly once a week, I would need to email my section TF asking about the due dates for all these mini assignments because there could be up to THREE DIFFERENT dates given to us (Gcal says one day, Canvas calendar says another day, and the weekly PS11 newsletter says a third day). This course had several critical organizational issues that created unnecessary confusion for my peers and me. In addition, the way that the gradescope submissions work, a student will upload a scanned document and the computer will automatically assign each problem to a specific part of each page. Most of the time this saves the student a few minutes of needing to manually assign each problem to a specific page. However, on multiple of my Psets, the computer would incorrectly assign one part of a page to a specific problem (it thinks that Problem 3 is in the middle of Page 4, but it is actually a few centimeters farther down based on how I scanned my pages) and I would automatically get a 0 on that problem. The computer put a little box around where it thinks the problem should be, instead of where it actually is on the page, and the result is the TF grading that problem is given an incomplete or non–existent portion of my work. Super frustrating because then my TF said ""sorry, there's nothing we can do about this because the computer does that automatically"". Finally, many of the TF's are clearly not excited about this course, or have no idea what's going on. There were many times when I would be given an incorrect answer at office hours and then would need to go to office hours later that day to double check the first TF's answers. Several times, they made me feel like I was a burden to double check answers, even though it is not my fault that a previous TF had point–blank told me an incorrect answer.",-0.9674,,0.0

They are very fair. They reflect what we learned in class and also a good reflection of the practice exam. There has never been a problem on the exam that we have not seen a variation of on the pset or on practice exams. As someone who was taking 6 classes during the semester, I didn't put that much time in this class, but I still came out with a rudimentary understanding of chemistry and was not incredibly stressed. I think it is only stressful if you do things last minute. I have always started pset part I, the online portion, about 3 hrs before it's due. A 90% gives you full credit, so don't stress about making things perfect. There is a point of diminishing returns. Here is my work flow if you wish to have an understanding of the weekly workload: I start part II on Saturdays. I don't do anything before then. I go to the 2 hrs office hours and then the additional office hours with Joe, who won't be on the teaching staff next year, but I complete the most of the pset on Saturday. I leave Sunday and Monday for sometimes when the pset is longer than usual. This class really isn't supposed to be rocket science, and people that say it is so, they just want to be perfect, and you can't always have that. Find other things worth your time to be stressed about. You don't have to be perfect to get an A. There are also plenty of opportunities to savage your pset and lab scores. Lectures are fun. I enjoy Frank's way of presentation. We go through the mathematics, and there are also fun demonstrations. You just need to buy into this class in order to enjoy this. I am speaking as someone who has taken chem 20 before taking this class. This class is much easier than any of the orgo classes, but the two classes are completely unrelated. It's also more entertaining than any orgo class you will take. You don't have to take this class before orgo. So, feel free to take this class when you are junior like me. And like don't gatekeep. There is a mutual benefit with sharing and discussing answers. It's never that serious that you must hide your answers from your peers. You are not pitted against your peers. This class is not curved, so don't focus on strategizing against your classmates. There is always a bunch of people like that in every OH. Please do not be like those people.You will do most of your practical learning with your section TF. Go Elena!! Best TF ever. She does a great overview of the topics and then goes through the problems with us instead of forcing us to attempt it on our own. She lets us do that if we have multiple problems that have a similar set up, but she understands that there is a limited amount of time to get through all the problems, and she rather go through all the problems with us then make us try to go through the solutions by ourselves. kween behavior. For exam studying tips, I highly suggest going over pset part II problems. Never bother with part I. Then go over Lu's review study guides. Those videos are holy grails. If you don't have time for the full videos, I highly suggest watching the sections of the videos where she goes through some examples if you think you have a good grasp of the basic. There are some unique examples that may benefit you on the exams. You get a cheat sheet front and back for each exam, so fill it up with things that she says. My main gripe about this class is the wacky lab schedule. Like, this is genuinely my only issue with this class. It was genuinely so odd how there was an A  and B group. But then it wasn't consistent? So then what was the point? The idea was that group A students go first, then group B goes the next week. But sometimes, we had both groups going each week. Friday's section is the last to go for one lab, but for the next lab topic, they somehow become the first class to go. And then tell me why the prelab for the next lab is due before the lab report for the current lab. I think the Friday's lab sections got screwed over the most this semester. And then for the weeks that Friday's group goes last, every single group, no matter if you were monday's lab from the week before or friday's lab, everyone had the same due date. That's simply not fair for people who only had the weekend to put together the lab report versus someone who has the whole week.",0.9981,"Beginning before the semester started, I was surprised at how disorganized the course felt. Before the first lecture on the first day of classes, we already needed to watch a lecture, scan and submit a few pages of work, and complete Pset 0 Part 2 (but not part 1 yet). If I had not checked canvas in the middle of January, a week before classes started, I would have already been several hours behind on the first day. This pattern continued throughout the semester, with several things being due each week, all at different times. At the beginning, the head TF explained that many people fall behind in this course, so they split each assignment up into sub–parts with multiple checkpoints per week, BUT this method actually had the reverse effect by making me more anxious about all the little due dates. For example, there is a Pset Part 1, Pset Part 2, Pre–lab, and Lab Report due each week but on four different days (and across Canvas, Gradescope, and EdX platforms), so I needed to re–allocate my time each week depending on which of those assignments were due when. What's a simple solution to the scheduling problem? Create a class Gcal! Great idea. This course had a class Gcal that we were required to subscribe to as part of Pset 0 Part 2. HOWEVER, the Gcal was never updated and often contained outdated or flat–out incorrect information about due dates. Roughly once a week, I would need to email my section TF asking about the due dates for all these mini assignments because there could be up to THREE DIFFERENT dates given to us (Gcal says one day, Canvas calendar says another day, and the weekly PS11 newsletter says a third day). This course had several critical organizational issues that created unnecessary confusion for my peers and me. In addition, the way that the gradescope submissions work, a student will upload a scanned document and the computer will automatically assign each problem to a specific part of each page. Most of the time this saves the student a few minutes of needing to manually assign each problem to a specific page. However, on multiple of my Psets, the computer would incorrectly assign one part of a page to a specific problem (it thinks that Problem 3 is in the middle of Page 4, but it is actually a few centimeters farther down based on how I scanned my pages) and I would automatically get a 0 on that problem. The computer put a little box around where it thinks the problem should be, instead of where it actually is on the page, and the result is the TF grading that problem is given an incomplete or non–existent portion of my work. Super frustrating because then my TF said ""sorry, there's nothing we can do about this because the computer does that automatically"". Finally, many of the TF's are clearly not excited about this course, or have no idea what's going on. There were many times when I would be given an incorrect answer at office hours and then would need to go to office hours later that day to double check the first TF's answers. Several times, they made me feel like I was a burden to double check answers, even though it is not my fault that a previous TF had point–blank told me an incorrect answer.",-0.9674,,0.0

Professor Hamilton is the definition of a compelling lecturer – his expansive and intricate knowledge of this topic specifically made this class such a gift to take. I left every lecture feeling as if I'd gotten closer to the meaning of life, and energized about what it means to be a student. Specifically, Professor H's lecture notes are so carefully crafted and truly a huge treasure to have the chance to interact with as a student of this course. The side notes on the board of words in Latin, Greek, French, and more now populate my well–loved notebook from this course. As a lover of literature and a classical singer I can say with certainty that this class was formative to my life as an academic as well as artist. I hope this course will continue in the years to come – I would even come to audit it again because of how comprehensive and dense the literature is (in the best way!) – and that the humanities/german department will continue to generate and support classes about the role of music in literature, in addition to the rich canon of literature about musical genius. If you are a true academic, take this course – it feels like a graduate seminar simultaneously in Classics/Greek/Philosophy/Music/German/English and more which makes it truly a special experience to participate in. :)",0.9948,,0.0,Can't recommend this enough! I joined late because I was figuring out my schedule and I was instantly glad I joined after the first lecture. Hamilton is an amazing lecturer and we need more lecturers like him!

She is very knowledgeable about what she is teaching and beyond. She is able to weave everyone's comments together to produce a very generative conversation. She is great at facilitating discussions using concrete questions and ad–lib comments that are somehow just as insightful. On top of that, she runs her class with a great structure/scaffold without being rigid at all. She provides a recapitulation of the previous classes, and these summaries help everyone to wake up and weave things together. She is overall a very organized person – her course website is so easy to navigate. She makes herself available to students despite her own responsibilities – I don't know how she does it! Go to her office hours: she will surprise you with a constellation of knowledge, and at the same time, remain humble and never pushy. She really wants you to explore your own interests, and she's there to provide detailed, concrete, and theoretical feedback wherever you need, without trying to enforce her opinions on you.

To get the concentration requirement for CS and a pretty much guaranteed A, I would highly recommend this course. Definitely better to tka eif you know people or have friends in the class because then you can work together. If you really want to learn scientific code needed for engineering, I found that I actually learned more in PS12 than in CS32... Regardless, this class teaches you how to think like a coder and pushes you to think in new ways. If you put in the work, do all the psets, go to office hours, attend lectures, you will learn in this class. However, it is really easy to not go to lecture, barely do the homeworks, and barely do the psets so I would suggest being mindful of that when it comes to learning to code vs just getting a good grade. Also Mike and Kitty are awesome. When people participate in lecture it's much more fun!!",0.9873,"I would not recommend this class. This is the first cs class I took here and while I found the material reasonable and easy to understand, I was incredibly disappointed with how boring and unrelated to the psets the lectures where, how useless the skills the psets were based on where.

Oh and there's a midterm on the last day of class (a final basically) and still, there's a final project. I also think it says something that so many people switched to pass–fail after the first exam, which had a mean that was not a passing score, but hey, curves are a thing so take that w a grain of salt. Anyways I hated this class and the horrible organization and assignments but there is a chance you may like it.",-0.9484,,0.0

This course's prerequisites are that you have done a CS internship, but CS 1060 reteaches you the least important concepts in the most confusing way possible or YouTube–able way possible. As it's the first time this course is being offered, I want to give the course staff the benefit of the doubt as they have a large task at hand –– managing a ton of student teams and ensuring that they all work together and work well to create a fully tested and developed product. However, the course itself can do with a lot of restructuring and improvements to narrow down the scope of what is taught and in handling the assignments in the course. To begin, the homework is extremely wordy and most of the time difficult to understand (with points taken off arbitrarily for things like naming, etc). The biggest investment you have to make in this course is the number of times you have to re–log into Canvas after Harvard changed their login to Okta to open the 10 tabs you'll need to understand a single portion of the poorly worded homework problem where you'll be spending 2.5x the time you actually spent on the homework on deploying your app. The in class attendance reading quizzes were inconsistent at best and extremely undoable at worst, specifications for the final projects were given late, the lecture topics weren't planned well, and the TFs were unknowledgeable about fundamental grading criteria regarding projects, and feedback itself was generally unspecific and SAT/UNSAT homework assignments, although well intentioned, encouraged team members to just 'get the work done' regardless of the quality of the code or work. The extra credit for talking in class, responding on Ed, etc. was vague and there's not a great way to track this.Harvard is in desperate need of an industry standard software engineering course especially with all of the theoretical and research focus in the degree, and it's great that we're moving towards a more application direction outside of the systems and HCI courses (61, 161, 178, 262, 265, etc). This class attempts to tackle a lot of topics, and although a prerequisite of the course is having done multiple CS courses or an internship, the course has a fault of either introducing fundamental topics such as git way too late in the semester, assuming an understanding of fundamental software engineering concepts (i.e. code reviews, testing, deployment, etc), or in having a hard time finding a balance between teaching software engineering and generative AI. Until we have a more robust foundation for software engineering concepts in the coursework at Harvard, it can be difficult to assemble groups and assume that everyone is on a similar knowledge level on engineering concepts. I was surprised that even some general architecture / writing usable code (concepts such as KISS, SOLID principles, factories, etc) weren't covered, although this is more on the general software engineering side rather than software engineering and generative AI. I wish there was a focus on more fundamental topics in order to help teammates as people are coming from different backgrounds, and being in a team where half of the team doesn't know how git works can doom you to merge conflict hell.Regardless of all of this, this is one of the most useful CS courses that you'll be able to do if you want a good understanding of software engineering or just want to be forced to work a LOT with generative AI (if you haven't been doing so already.) It introduces people to something that will be very important to know for the future, ticketing with Linear, working with Git with many other people, and more. It's a very well intentioned course that can be successful and a fundamental one to take for every CS student in future iterations. Christopher, although he can be a bit of a personality that some people may not like, is knowledgable, helpful, and always available and understanding. Christopher clearly cares a lot about the course and is a great person to get to know –– we do need more courses like this at Harvard. However, for the course as it is now, going in with a good team that's excited to work together on a project idea will make or break your experience. The actual experience of working with different generative AI tools and learning how to prompt engineer, debug, and write tests is extremely helpful for the future. However, if you're less familiar with some software lifecycle concepts or are going in alone, I'd be cognizant of taking this course if you don't want to be hunting down teammates to submit assignments.",0.9944,,0.0,,0.0

Or that for two–sided matchings, it is mathematically impossible to have a rule that incentivize both sides to be honest–reporting, while resulting in a matching that is stable (where pairs won’t want to switch partners). Or that for allocating schools to students, it’s impossible to have a mechanism that satisfy all the following properties together: incentivizes honest–reporting, equal treatment of students with equal preferences, and doesn’t result in a subpar matching that a better matching exists. Incredibly fundamental results with extremely practical results.Probably the best class I have taken at Harvard (but this is conditioning on me as a junior and after taken some proof classes, and is interested in voting and allocating resources and fairness) (I am not a 55 kid though)Time split by week, rounded up by hour2, 5, 4, 2, 13, 6, 3, 7, 5, 7, 8, 4, 13, 2, 5, 3The two spikes are 2/23–3/3 (one week before midterm) and 4/20–4/28 (one week before reading period, last pset, I think I was doing some catching–up studying during this week).Lectures are required, but Ariel’s lectures are the best I have had at Harvard.

It culminates with your final project that will build on an advanced topic of your choice. Topics and course structure are subject to change year–to–year with emerging trends, particularly in AI (in both your learning and in AI learning).Professor: HT is lovely. The class is quite concept–driven (especially in the era of generative AI), with HT making sure you understand “why” protocols are designed the way they are, “where” a protocol applies, and “what” assumptions are behind the protocol, beyond just “how” it is implemented. Textbooks: Kurose and Ross is useful for nitty–gritty protocol details (particularly for the first programming assignment), though don’t get too caught up in the nitty–gritty. Kurose and Ross, Computer Networking: A Top–Down Approach, Eighth Edition. Topics covered: Network layers and protocols (Physical layer, link layer, network layer, transport layer, application); L1–to–L3 interactions; L2 switching and L3 routing; routing protocols (distance vector, link–state); L4 transport protocols (TCP, UDP); TCP congestion control; wireless networking (antennas, RF, ALOHA, CSMA CA/CD, CSMA backoff, ns–3 simulation); internet from space (LEO, inter–sat links, HARQ), software–defined networks; network security (public key, Diffie–hellman, RSA, hash chain, DNS); blockchain/bitcoin (decentralized distributed ledger, public key encryption and authentication, ownership transfer, double–spending prevention, proof–of–work consensus, bitcoin mining and incentives), AI–assisted networking (reinforcement learning (RL) based random access channel protocol vs. slotted ALOHA, RL–based congestion control vs. TCP).

The material can be interesting but there is a lack of support and the professor expects the world from you despite not being able to teach the subject well.

The material is very, very abstract, so it may be a bit unintuitive at first, but there are a lot of tidbits here and there that make for very interesting material –– some really weird math is sometimes sprinkled in to formalize things, and it's always quite fun. I think this class plays a complementary role to CS121: if your CS education is a brick wall, 121 is the grout, and 152 is the finishing coat, filling in the few details that really make everything work together. As someone who has never cared at all about systems, for instance, the framework given in 152 has really inspired me to go think about the implementations of programming languages in compilers, etc. in ways I'd really brushed off before.The class itself is not a huge amount of work: to be sure, it's backloaded, so be careful about the amount of work at the end of the semester, but the exams were fair, the TFs very helpful (shoutout to my personal GOAT, Jonas), and Prof. Amin is incredibly knowledgeable about the material and friendly. Her knowledge of the material is a bit of a double–edged sword: she's clearly incredibly smart and a fantastic researcher, but this means she assumed we all are, too, so a lot of the examples given in class are a bit too difficult to pick up on the fly, and I think they could benefit from a tad more hands–on time with the material over pure powerpoint lecture (she live–codes in a really impressive way, though, I have to give her that).I thoroughly enjoyed this class, and would highly recommend it to folks looking to round out their theoretical CS education or looking for a good bridge between theory and systems, because you really see both come alive.",0.9967,"There are not many good spring classes, so this one is one of the only ones that is relatively chill.

His insecurity and incompetence are a large part of what is making this course so frustrating. His motto should be “good catch,” because that is what he says when a student points out a glaring error in his math.  At this point, I don’t trust what’s written on the board until I verify it against the textbook myself. I don't fully trust the textbook, but at least it's a concrete thing I can refer to. It's clear Finale is delegating much of the professorial work to David because of her demanding schedule. It is also clear David is not rising to this challenge. –––––––––––––––––––––––Midterm–––––––––––––––––––––––The midterm was a disaster. It was far too long, riddled with typos that had to be corrected in real time, and included poorly constructed questions. Nearly everyone I spoke with didn’t finish it in time. I left the exam demoralized.What was the pedagogical reasoning behind assigning an exam that most students were bound to fail? Was it some kind of hazing ritual? A test of ego? Why not simply assess the material as it was actually taught?Before the exam, I overheard Finale mention to David that a particular question “really made me think” and “took a while to work through.” I’d ask the professors to reflect on how long it took them to solve that problem—and then consider how long it might take a student seeing it for the first time under strict time pressure. How is that pedagogically sound? What is being accomplished? –––––––––––––––––––––––Final Exam–––––––––––––––––––––––The final exam was also long and very difficult. I read the entire textbook, reworked every problem, and reviewed the lectures multiple times—and still received a poor grade. At least the time limit wasn’t as much of a constraint as during the midterm.–––––––––––––––––––––––Final Thoughts–––––––––––––––––––––––As of now, final grades have not been released. Without a curve, my grade is around 75%, despite earning A–level marks on all non–exam material. I genuinely have no idea what my final grade will be, because the course team has failed to communicate that information. That lack of transparency reflects a broader disrespect toward students.",-0.9965,,0.0

Prof. Vadhan is clearly very knowledgeable, and has done much interesting work in the area. The course itself is not particularly technical, but rather focuses on applications and discussions. Many of the readings are journal/magazine articles regarding opinions of privacy, and privacy from various viewpoints. There is an introduction to the basic technical details, e.g. definitions of DP, elementary mechanisms, and properties such as post–processing, etc. Overall, the course does well to provide a broad introduction of DP, both from a theory and application standpoint. Nonetheless, I feel that there could have been more depth and pace to the class. For instance, the introduction to DP–ML discussed some elementary algorithms such as DP–SGD and their implementation, but did not go further beyond (whereas in the literature there are both many optimization algorithms, as well as various proof techniques). Class sometimes consisted of discussions, which were nice, and going over code, which probably could have been omitted (probably reading a 100–line jupyter notebook could be assigned as homework). There are weekly problem sets, which take a relatively short (but still not completely trivial) amount of time. Lastly, there is a final project, which I quite enjoyed. Prof. Vadhan's feedback is quite good, and the field of DP contains a significant amount of interesting theory and application. The poster presentations at the end were interesting and allowed us to see the breadth of work done by other groups. I would probably encourage taking cs226 for a more theoretical side of this course, but if you are interesting to knowing the basics of privacy and learning an overview of where privacy mechanisms are applied, this would be a fitting course.",0.9905,"lectures are pretty bad imo.

Like, really bad. I wish “CS2540 says I speaksfor CS2540” so that I could make CS2540 say all the problems about itself. I want to robustly declassify and transparently endorse the pain of this class to the rest of the world while maintaining nonmalleable information flow.Starting with the lectures. They are not informative. On a lattice, it feels like Steve’s lectures are secret untrusted and I am public trusted with how difficult it is to make the lecture information flow to my brain. But when you ask a question, it flips; you suddenly become secret untrusted and public trusted as you can’t get any meaningful questions to Steve.It feels like Steve assumes too much during lectures. The prerequisites that he states (Good CS student and taken Formal Reasoning before) is nowhere enough as Steve will sometimes just skip over details and assume you know them when he has never taught them before. This creates problems; eventually he will just lose you unless you have studied this topic before, which is unfair to the students who took the listed prerequisites in good faith. Even with some knowledge of PL, a lot of his lectures are indecipherable. Steve says HisLectures speaksfor Steve, but the problem is that HisLectures says Indecipherable speaksfor HisLectures.Onto the homework. Why do they exist? What is the line between a “check” and a “check–plus” grade on the homework? Nobody knows. The line is so nonexistent that it will make you question whether you know the line using epistemic logic. What world are you in? Are you in a world where the line is clear? The homeworks say no. Are you in a world where you know that the homeworks are meaningful? The homeworks say no. In fact, using epistemic logic, you will eventually come to the conclusion that K_{You}(CS 2540 is a bad class). Of course, the only way you will know this is if you experience what set of worlds you may be in by taking the class, but I hope that this observation is enough for you.In fact, the class can be written in Tamarin like this. [CS2540()]––[]–>[Out(BadClass)]. Which, speaking of, is the worst homework I have experienced. No instructions, just pain. No practice in class, just pain. Steve gives you zero preconditions, and somehow expects your postcondition to contain happiness of working with Tamarin. Give us those preconditions. But given that the prerequisite list is terrible, is it a surprise that the preconditions are lacking?The project. Nothing but pain. Lack of instructions. Lack of rubrics. Lack of basis on grading. It’s so arbitrary that you can’t ever know if Steve is grading fairly or not. In fact, it seems likely that he isn’t. “Steve will always grade fairly” is a safety property, and if Execution Monitoring tried to enforce this property on this class, the class would have been canceled as soon as Steve began to grade. “Steve will eventually make good lectures for CS2540” is a liveness property, but it remains unsatisfied. No well–founded relation can be found to save this class.If you are still considering taking this course, think of a model of CS2540 that we will reason with. Reasoning through, we find that the class is vulnerable to a side channel. Through the pain it inflicts on its students, a side channel characterized by the stress of its students is created. Even when you have exploited this side channel, why would you try to experience a class of this exploitable model yourself? CS2540 and a class where you struggle and don’t learn much are contextually equivalent.To this end, remember that you have your secrets. With how public the pain of CS2540 is, if you want to enforce noninterference, you should not take this course and begin the transfer of information from a secret source to a public source. You might think you are going to take a fun formal reasoning course, but you have actually been exploited by a Man in the Middle Attack. You are communicating with a terrible class that is pretending to be a good formal reasoning course that has purposefully set up a Needham–Schroeder protocol to abuse this attack after throwing away Lowe from its protocol.Do not take this class. 1/5.",-0.9904,,0.0

If I could go back in time, I would rather have dropped out of the SM and avoided taking this class. Please note that the following is my opinion, and in no way supposed to be an ad hominem critique of any of the course staff. The anecdotes I include are important to understanding why I have the opinion of the class I do.My background: CS61, 120, 124, AC209ab, other 2000–level CS, stat classes…I will touch on a couple points:0 – the readingsWaldo usually puts up 2–3 links for a lecture. One is usually an old paper, sometimes written in a very specific research group, assuming familiarity with terms no one has familiarity with. One is usually a link to a recent whitepaper/documentation (e.g. https://protobuf.dev/). No guidance on how much one should read into one or the other. Some are 60 or more pages, some are just a webpage. 90%+ of the class does not read the papers. When he asked in lecture, ""how many of you think you understand how Paxos works,"" no one raised their hand. When he asked ""how many think they do not understand,"" again no one is bothered enough to raise their hand. His reaction: ""That's because none of you have read the paper."" He is right. This kind of atmosphere sums up the attitude of students towards the class, and the atmosphere that lectures have.1 – lectures, the form:I attended nearly every lecture, kept notes, and still feel like I learned next to nothing. As you probably have heard, the slides are one word each. Ostensibly, this is to remind the professor what the flow is of what he wanted to cover. However, it seemed as though he has forgotten why he put some of the words on the slides, and thus, though he tries to find a way to weave from one word to the next in the context of what is being discussed, the lecture feels like a ramble, rather than us learning anything systematic about a distributed systems topic. This is the case throughout the semester.  The most interesting class was when the professor got the CEO of a small Boston area tech company and alum of the class to give a lecture about distributed systems in practice. This was a nice addition. The take–away from this class, ironically though, was ""don't build distributed systems unless you really have to.""2– lectures, the contentI think none of the material was particularly relevant to modern distributed systems– though I am still not proficient in them. You come to learn that most of the terms (""RPC, wire protocols, message passing, testing, byzantine failure"") are just describing common sense design aspects you will learn anyway when building any larger–scale project. Learning about some obscure aspects of Java was not useful. You do not learn anything about networking, though this layer seems important for really understanding the design of wire protocols. The lectures that actually cover an interesting algorithm/content, like Paxos/Raft/Blockchain, are not well delivered. I learned more from a YouTube video on Raft than from the attempt at explaining the algorithm, which I felt did not cover the basic notions of how a 'quorum' works, for example. These classes felt as though the content was assumed to be known, and only the professor's (usually strong) prior opinion of Blockchain/Raft was being discussed. No real theory of distributed systems is built through the class, it is hard to see how the topics connect to each other. Most people stopped showing up to lecture pretty quickly.3– the assignmentsNearly everyone in the class used AI to complete the three assignments, the 'design exercises,' as the syllabus allowed. After I coded it myself, I found that ChatGPT O1 could pretty close to one–shot the design exercise based just on the design instructions given. The rest of your task was then to iron out tedious bugs. Many peers reported that they felt like there was ""no point in trying to do the coding yourself anyway"", because the implementation was mostly just nitpicky design details that didn't teach much about the distributed aspect (e.g. for the distributed messaging app, ""If the recipient is logged in, deliver immediately; if not the message should be stored until the recipient logs in and requests to see the message."") This left the in–class demo–days devoid of much interesting discussion. Everyone had pretty much done the same thing, and many groups were just trying to show one another up, or pass something that AI had coded for them off as worthy of extra credit for the peer grading component of the course. Even these opportunities to show off one's work felt demoralizing, unfortunately.Miraculously, around 3 times more students showed up on demo day than on lecture days. This goes to show that lectures were not necessary to complete the assignment.The first of the assignments basically was most of the work of the class (though this was not clear from the start) one whole pset was just to redo how messages were communicated for the first assignment. One assignment was to implement Lamport Logical clocks that talk to each other, and most students agreed that they did not see the use in this assignment, that this felt largely like busy–work.If any feedback was given on assignment, it was usually a couple sentences based on a skim of your work.The extent of guidance given on the final project was not much more than that we should ""demonstrate what we learned in the course"" and a couple sentences of feedback on a proposal document. On group size, the professor discouraged any groups larger than two by saying ""My general rule is that the difficulty of the final project should be proportional to 2**n, where n is the number of people on the team."" This announcement came somewhat late. We were asked to create both the code with testing and documentation, a poster, and a 10–page write–up on our final project. It was not clear why all the different formats were necessary, as only the write–up was looked at it seems like.Despite all this, I still probably spent around 10h a week on the class.4 – the gradingPositive: Waldo and the course staff were supportive and gracious of late days for medical emergencies and other valid excuses.Negative: You are supposed to get enough information from your peers' 15–minute code reviews to give them a grade out of 5. The actual criteria by which you are to grade them are only released a day before the class. In one case, the criteria included that the lamport clock servers that communicate each be their own process, and that this be verified in the code review. This was a minor detail/unclear in the original spec, and many people rushed to redo their implementation, though it was not clear why this was at all important. You were also graded on how well you graded, with the stark warning that your grade would be impacted if your assigned grade was further than 1 point away from the grade the teaching staff give the project…A friend of mine had a Canvas grade of over 96% in 4 graded aspects of the class, coming down basically to two points missed out of 25 based on a misreading of their final project write–up. When the friend wrote an email to the course staff to inquire about some feedback on the final project that could only have been due to a misreading, the professor wrote back to them and said that due to his participation, he would raise their grade from an A– to an A in the class. It seems like grading is essentially up–curved at the very high mean grade that students have in the class (because everyone has done the same on the assignments) and your class grade mostly comes down to the impression the course staff get of your final project. It is still mind–boggling to me that a 96% could equate to an A–. Waldo was unwilling to release information on grade cut–offs:doing that means I get to deal with an large number of ""you gave me three points less than I think I deserve"" which is neither productive for learning nor a good useexe of time.""5– the TFsthey did their best and were very approachable. no one showed up to their office hours for the most part.Please stay away from 262.

Class assignments are two take–home quizzes and a final paper –– a chill workload, and it was actually kinda enjoyable.",0.9509,,0.0,,0.0

The course was also super accessible, understandable, and interesting even for a CS/Stat concentrator like me with basically no experience in Buddhism or arts analysis at all. Also Professor Abe is just super sweet, understanding, and passionate about the topic, which was always a delight to listen to.

When I took the sequence the most common student was a Korean–American who wanted to learn the language after having heard it at home growing up. This means they are usually not starting from scratch but rather have pretty good listening skills at the very least, but sometimes have good speaking and/or good familiarity with the vocabulary already. This is not a huge deal as the course itself is not tailored to these types but rather accessible for a total beginner so don't worry about it if you are a total beginner. I mention this to characterize the position from which I am writing the review, as a total beginner and as a non–Korean person. The main thing I'll say about Korean BB is that the workload is quite a bit higher than that of Korean BA. I felt like I cruised through BA for the most part but from the first week of BB I (and others) felt the significant uptick in the pace and amount of stuff we were doing. The workload itself is very similar to that of BA and follows the same weekly patterns, but the volume of new content is higher which makes it tougher. That said, if you want to learn Korean this is the place to be and I think BB is the more important part of the first year sequence as we covered things that are closer to real world use. For example, this is the semester where we learned to ask if people want to do things like get dinner etc, so if you are on the fence about whether you should take BB after taking BA in pursuit of actually getting to a point where Korean is useful for you, definitely take it.",0.9906,,0.0,,0.0

Anne is great and super enthusiastic about the content of the class, and altho it's kinda early, she really does try her best to keep everyone awake and engaged!

Anne is a good lecturer but I found the slides to be hard to follow, and this made studying for midterms/finals difficult. Know that most of your grade will come from entirely multiple choice assessments (for us, midterm+final were 60% of the grade, and they were both entirely multiple choice). This is the same as on cycle ec10, but you also have a bunch of other random assignments that they do not. For example, the deep dives and final project. Deep dives are every two or three weeks, and they are a big time commitment. That is what makes the course so hard to follow; you can't plan out how much time you need per week because it is always changing. The deep dives and final project also have very little relevance to the exams, so it is a frustrating mix of needing to still do the assignments but knowing they are not helping for the main chunk of the graded part of the class. It is a fine class, but I wouldn't recommend if you aren't considering an econ concentration. Just take it on cycle; this class is inconsistent and harder than I feel it should be.",-0.7988,,0.0

I absolutely loved this class. Our tutorial focused on managerial decision making, and the readings that Omar selected tied into important business and technology problems and helped me to critically think about real–world business challenges. I found this to be much more applicable than many other courses I've taken here, and it's a course I feel confident will shape the way I think about business problems for many years to come. It also drastically improved my ability to read research papers, understand econometric methods, and write essays, largely because of the way that Omar broke down these topics, provided in–depth feedback, and always made expectations clear for assignments. He is incredibly knowledgeable about econometrics, business, and technology, and he knew the papers very well and helped our class think about them on a much deeper level. Not only that, but we had many engaging class activities that I really enjoyed and that helped me learn in a more hands–on way.  This course could have doubled as instruction about how the ideal class should be taught. I've never felt this sad for a course to come to an end; it was truly an amazing class and I feel very lucky to have been in it, especially with Omar as my instructor.As far as other advice, I'd recommend at least concurrently taking econometrics, as this will really help understand the methods of papers. I'm not sure if Omar will teach another tutorial, but if he does I'd highly recommend taking one with him. I'd also say to choose a topic you're interested in, as this will make it easier to get through the readings and stay engaged during the class discussions. Additionally, the PSETs provide a lot more support for Stata than R, so I'd recommend Stata if you're choosing between languages. Finally, don't underestimate the workload, as you will have to complete PSETs, do many readings, and write papers, including a very long final paper. All of this can lead to a pretty significant workload, although I don't think that any of the work ever felt like busy work which I appreciated.",0.9973,,0.0,,0.0

If you love problem–solving, this course is definitely a great fit for you. You also get to know your peers as a lot of work in class is in groups, and I have made friends through that.

If you have any interest in finance, psychology (how it interacts with finance), or finding interesting exogenous variables and natural experiments (somewhat in the style of Freakonomics), then I strongly recommend this course. I came into it with no finance experience or background and Professor Stein does a great job of explaining basic concepts while discussing important papers in the field. I had little to no trouble keeping up. Further, the final project is a great opportunity to test out if you'd like to write a thesis or if you enjoy economics/finance research; it is super free form and Professor Stein has no expectations for how it turns out, only that you work hard on it and demonstrate effort. The weekly discussion papers initially intimidated me since I have no experience reading academic papers, but after just 2–3 weeks I enjoyed reading the papers and writing my thoughts about them and could get it done in an hour or so. I think this course is perfect for anyone interested in finance, considering writing a thesis senior year, or interested in the intersection of psychology and economics.

Initially, I found a lot of the course pre–requisites really scary because there's statistics, linear algebra, and multivariable calculus. However, a lot of the course material doesn't require extensive knowledge of these topics. As someone who was very curious how econometrics works from a statistical and theoretical perspective, I found this class very interesting. I had taken EC50 a year prior, so I was familiar with the R implementations for various causal inference observational studies and wanted to understand the math behind them. If you're more so interested in getting very comfortable with applying these techniques in R, then EC1123 would probably be better for you. This class goes in–depth into derivations and mathematical assumptions, which gets really interesting as you progress. Also, the material nicely builds on top of each other, and there are cool topics that the Professor will discuss without them being tested on the final, giving students an opportunity to just enjoy the material. If you are thinking about doing EC1126 vs STAT 111 and EC1123, I'd say that EC1126 does a nice job in providing all the relevant statistical insights that you need for econometrics with good pacing. The course textbook is really good, the slides are very insightful, and the sections have nice R code implementations. The homework is also very close to the lecture material, which contrasts other classes where you might need to go OH to OH to even understand what a problem is stating let alone how to approach it. Lastly, Professor Viviano is amazing and genuinely wants you to succeed. He designs assignments close to the lectures so that the focus is on understanding the core class material.

Shleifer is big on finding ""interesting correlations"", which essentially means finding a niche or heretofore unexplored dataset and finding something worthwhile in that dataset. If you're going to take the class, you might as well try your hardest to come up with something cool, especially since everyone in the class—likely due to selection bias—does a really good job.

Everyone wants to come out of a class feeling the course expanded their thinking, exposed them to new ideas, and that they’ve built skills and knowledge within the course useful elsewhere—I feel this way about the course. I find the afternoon lecture time hard and Professor Stavins lectures in a relatively tranquil / monotone way for most of the time so try and energize yourself before coming to the lecture as it can sometimes be hard to maintain focus — many students did not come to lecture but you should go!! Stavins has many interesting and relevan stories to share form his experiences with the content we discuss and is humorous — lecture really grew on me throughout the semester as the class got to know one another and we got a better background under us for learning more content. Microeconomics background helpful, but do not be concerned if not! You will be expected to do some quantitative problem–solving on exams, so know that it’s not entirely policy / qualitative analysis. If you haven’t looked at the syllabus, be aware this course grades almost solely on the exams so basically all your learning through the semester is graded through two tests. I will say that the exams felt more quantitate / problem solving like in comparison to lecture — I don’t think lecture prepares you for a lot of the thinking required on the exam and you build your exam abilities more through the problem sets and practice exams — lecture is more high level and qualitative. Lectures felt more like a gov class, while exams felt more like a Ec10 exam. Go to office hours with Stavins!

I think those reviews will be more representative than for this year due to the different professor, but I'll still give my views on the course this semester as most should still be applicable.This course is a very nonintimidating introduction to fundamental financial concepts (stocks, bonds, derivatives) and I think it would be beneficial to everyone, not just econ majors or those considering finance. It delves much deeper than EC 70 (personal finance) into these concepts and would be useful knowledge for everyone, as you will eventually need to decide what assets to invest in with retirement accounts and savings.The class is not terribly theoretical, much less so than the main 1010/1011ab sequences. It's mostly just applying formulas and some basic intuition and is honestly very straightforward, especially if you have a stats background (e.g. Stat 110). You really won't be too surprised by exam questions (though I think they're probably a bit harder under Gabaix than Liu). You're given plenty of practice materials, and since this is such a plug and chug class (applying formulas), the fact that you can use a cheat sheet on the exams means that you really don't have to memorize that much information and should be able to do well on the exams with not that much preparation.The homework assignments are very light and essentially graded for completion. You only have to complete 6 of the 9 to receive a full homework grade, so it's essentially a 6 pset class, which is roughly one every other week if you use all 3 of your drops. Office hours are helpful for psets, but ChatGPT can also help to explain concepts very well since the material isn't that advanced. Using ChatGPT to help on homework assignments actually taught me a lot and helped me gain a better understanding of the concepts since you can ask it to elaborate and relay your points of confusion, so I'd recommend trying that. This class shouldn't take any more than 5 hours a week if you use your resources, though this might pick up again right before the midterm and final. There are also weekly optional sections that can help you review concepts, though ChatGPT did a good enough job of helping reinforce topics to where I didn't need to go to section and I did well on the midterm and final (the curve is quite generous, by the way, though I don't know how it will be under Gabaix).Weiling was a great professor, though she probably won't return next year. I assume Gabaix is just as good, but I'd again recommend reading Spring 2024 reviews if you want the closest parallel. But I would say that any econ major should definitely take this class to fulfill their theory prereq requirement and learn quite useful and applicable information.",0.9977,"I would not really recommend taking this class without prior knowledge. Lecture is very theoretical whereas the problem sets and exams are highly mathematical/problem–solving based, and I don't think that mismatch helps students learn. If you're thinking of taking this course because you want to go into finance, save yourself and your GPA the trouble and take some other class instead (I particularly liked Corporate Finance). You really don't learn much practical knowledge relevant to whatever it is in finance you want to pursue. The professor this year was a substitute so I can't really speak for how this will be run next year, but I gathered that most students didn't really enjoy lecture as they weren't the most engaging/interesting nor were they helpful for completing the problem sets.",-0.8567,,0.0

This is coming from a finance bro background admittedly but it is the perfect blend of the holy trinity of 1) not too much work (a light assignment due every other week) & 2) learning a ton 3) & amazing lectures/professor! This is definitely the best finance undergrad course offered at Harvard – you gain a really strong understanding of debt overhang/restructuring, the limits of arbitrage, good history on the Great Depression and GFC, the role of the central bank’s balance sheet, QE, inflation mandate and even private credit. This course is a real emphasis on credit markets and the importance of credit in the economy so the way it talks about finance is from that lens – not at all about equity markets. You realize how important credit markets are to a functioning economy. Prof Stein is the most engaging, kind and humble lecturer I’ve ever had and probably ever will have at Harvard – cannot highly recommend his teaching enough. You can ask him even the most simple questions and he doesn’t judge you at all – great also at encouraging class participation. Get to know him through office hours or going out to dinner with him! Admittedly, you’ll want to have some basic financial background going into the course cause it will be helpful for getting up to speed and knowing the content – how bond yields move inversely to prices, the dual mandate of the Fed, basic restructuring. The first couple courses – especially the second one on debt overhang feels very overwhelming – basically an intro to RX, but trust me it gets easier from there and the first few lectures shouldn’t scare you if you have doubts on taking the course. Prof Stein is very helpful in answering any question you may have during or after class and you can go to the optional sections as well if you want further clarification of the material.",0.9979,"I would really have some prior knowledge before taking this class, because most students do and you will be at a disadvantage if you don't. The lectures are very engaging but the notes are not comprehensive, detailed, or very coherent which makes studying for the final quite difficult. This class is one of the few classes where having a final exam really does not make much sense. Almost all the assignments are papers/essays critiquing academic literature re: banking. I honestly thought it was unfair that we were not given some sort of practice test for the final; I'm a senior and I have never had a class not provide any sort of practice material for the final exam. Particularly since there is no midterm nor do the assignments mimic the format or style of the final, it felt a bit unfair. I will say, though, that the lectures are very interesting and you develop a very deep understanding of the financial system as a whole.

Listening to other students—many of whom are PhD candidates—debate and dissect the material during lectures was also one of the most intellectually stimulating aspects of the course. Professor Cutler is not only a world–class economist but also a generous and thoughtful teacher who truly cares about student learning. Even as an undergraduate, I felt welcomed in this PhD–level class. If you’re willing to put in the effort, this course will not only expand your academic toolkit but also fundamentally change how you think about economics. I couldn’t recommend it more.",0.9805,,0.0,,0.0

If you’re looking to engage in profound yet low–stress science while also having fun and learning how to make (and understand) fermented food, this class is for you.This is also very much an “only at Harvard” kind of class: the dedicated teaching space, overqualified and deeply engaged teaching staff, ample resources, exciting field trips, and guest lectures all come together to create a one–of–a–kind experience—an ideal bookend to your senior year.My only regret was not having more time to devote to it. That’s actually the one piece of advice I really hope you take: try to keep your schedule clear before and/or after class. I didn’t do this, so it’s definitely not a requirement—but if you can, it makes the cooking sessions feel much more relaxed (since you’re not rushing off to your next class), and it gives you the chance to stick around afterward and talk with the teaching team. That extra time also helps with the final project, which requires some work outside of regular class hours. Regarding the project, make sure to plan ahead, coordinate well with your group, and give the it your full effort—it’ll make the experience that much more fun and rewarding.Other than that, just come to class with energy and a willingness to get your hands dirty. If you do, this will be one of the highlights of your Harvard academic experience.",0.9955,,0.0,,0.0

I took this class as a prospective EE concentrator to test my interest in the different areas of EE. The class is split into two halves. Before spring break, we learned about analog circuits (taught by Gu) and after spring break, we did digital circuits and logic (taught by Reddi). The course content is very overwhelming in its pace and without a section (which would have been life changing) it is very easy to fall behind. Fortunately, Gu and Reddi are extremely accessible and helpful in office hours and answered all of my questions, even basic ones, without making me feel stupid or incapable. Get to know them if you can because they are so knowledgeable and willing to help or just chat! My experience in office hours affirmed my decision to concentrate in EE because once so many challenging concepts made sense to me, I realized that I loved learning about EE (particularly the digital side) more than anything else I have ever learned and I found the challenge very satisfying to work through. PSETs are long (as in 20+ pages) so you MUST start early.Things that could be improved:–From my understanding, the professor that normally teaches ES50 was on sabbatical so a lot of the course structure was very unorganized or changed at the last minute.–They promised us 3 weeks to work on our final projects, but we only got 2. Many, many hours were spent in the SEC getting it to work on a very rushed schedule.–I have never been mansplained to and talked down to so much in my life. It got to the point where I dreaded labs where I should have been looking forward to learning hands–on skills. If you are a woman taking this class and something bothers you, fix it right away. My biggest regret is not saying something as soon as it bothered me early in the semester. It would have been nice if resources about this were highlighted because I was not the only person with this experience.–I did ES50 without an extensive technical background or direct hands–on experience. My lab partner had already taken circuits classes and had had the opportunity to do many hands–on projects before ES50. Due to this mismatch and him wanting to do the labs as quickly as possible, I did not get as much out of the labs as I wanted to. Do not be afraid to switch lab partners.

This left us consistently behind, making it difficult to keep up with labs. VJ was the opposite: fast–paced and concise, but sometimes too much so. He’d call something “very important” and then move on after five minutes, leaving no room for questions or deeper understanding.Exams were stressful with the new shorter time limit.

I don't know if its always like that, but it would make sense if it did. I made some new friendships from this class, and made some amazing memories. I am a mathematics and electrical engineering major, but I believe this is still a useful class, as it helps you get 1. hands on experience, and 2. understand the steps that go into producing something like a robot. This is a skill I will continue to develop and definitely use in the future. The TAs are amazing(Taylor you are amazing the best Lab TA ever), they will help you with every pset, and lab work, they are very understanding. The professor is pretty good, very passionate when you get to talk to him about other things besides ES51, and is also just an amazing grader. The tests are a lot better with him grading them.

Not only does this course satisfy the junior engineering design requirement for only electrical engineering students, but it also imposes a strict grading system and enrollment process.Firstly, the grading system is harsh. While you will most likely leave the course with an A, the professor is just one of those teachers who refuse to give out a 100. It all boils down to the instructor's pedagogy, which I do not agree with. On the syllabus, it says that ""Everyone can’t be doing a great job with everything, all the time. It’s just not possible."" I find this comment to be a bit pessimistic. The course also has an enrollment cap that is very unfortunate – EWB chapters all around the world allow any student to contribute to ongoing projects. Even though our chapter is structured as a class, I  firmly believe that this course should be enrollment–cap free. Let students who would like to support humanitarian causes participate.ES105hfr counting as a junior design course only for electrical engineers is unnecessarily selective. Why EE majors in particular? If anything, the skills learned in ES105hfr are more aligned with civil/mechanical than electrical engineers. This course should satisfy the junior design requirement for all engineering students. I find myself discussing the structure around ES105hfr more than the content of the course itself – the work you do is great, there's no doubt about it.

I do wish that there was some more discussion about the relationships between different concepts and how to utilize them to inform them when designing (and not to just do calculations on a given design), so that we have more of an idea of how we would apply these in the future. The exams were also fair, and they were similar to the format of the homework questions, so it was not too stressful studying for the exams, although the two midterms were a time crunch.I liked the bridge competition at the end of the semester, but it would have been nice to get more guidance on how we can make sure that we're optimizing the strength–to–weight ratio and design tricks/lessons for it. I also wish the labs were more hands–on, usually, we just watched the experiment being done and then just recorded the data.

That said, you’ll gain a deep understanding of cell biology, and the course is both engaging and enjoyable!",0.9472,"This course is a hands–on meat grinder that teaches students highly applicable and relevant lab skills. If you are looking to hit the ground running as an undergrad with limited/no previous experience, this course will whip your ass into shape quicker than greased lightning.  The lab staff is supportive and available quite often, and TFs are highly invested in the course material, which helps to somewhat ease the demanding nature of the course. Admittedly, this course demands your time, but as an undergrad, the only way to improve your technique is to get reps at the bench, which takes time. This course is highly rewarding, and I personally feel as though I am walking away from this course with more takeaways than a majority of the other bio–related courses I have taken. As for Professor Parker, he is a somewhat polarizing man. He speaks with authority, and far more directly than other professors I have encountered. For some, this is a huge turn–off, especially if you are used to sugarcoated feedback and calm lectures that bore you to death. For others, myself included, direct constructive feedback is probably the most helpful thing I could ask for as a learning student. Bottom line: if you are doing something stupid, Parker will say ""hey, stop doing that stupid thing"" (sometimes in a more colorful manner).",-0.0092,,0.0

On one hand, the content is unique; Professor Capasso (if he's teaching it) is a juggernaut in the field and you'll learn concepts in the latter third of the class that don't have textbooks written on them yet. So, from a pure novelty perspective, I think it is worth considering. On the other hand, I didn't think Capasso was a very effective lecturer; he is someone who is highly intelligent, but not very aware of the level at which everyone else is at (especially undergrads) and either doesn't know how to communicate to us or simply doesn't care to do so effectively (I personally think it is the former).  The bulk of my learning in this class came from the TFs, Nicholas and Andrea (these two really made the class for me and if at least one of them is teaching the class, I think you'll have a fine time), and doing the homework assignments and exams. I will say that you should take my words a healthy amount of salt: this is a graduate level course and my only real preparation for the class was Physics 15B and Physics 143A and I've never taken an optics course of any kind in my life.

Screenwriting has a distinct and highly specific form, and choosing to write a screenplay, rather than a novel or short story, should be a deliberate and intentional decision. For many students, it felt like that choice wasn’t grounded in a true engagement with the medium, but rather in a desire to take a light or ""fun"" creative writing course. Without a strong interest in film, important conversations around cinematic form, structure, and visual storytelling tend to fall by the wayside. As a result, much of the feedback focused primarily on plot, which made the experience feel less like an exploration of screenwriting as an art form and more like a general storytelling workshop. This limited the course's potential to offer a truly transformational creative experience rooted in the unique language of screenwriting. If you're looking for a fun and creative writing course, this one absolutely fits that description. But if you're seriously interested in becoming a filmmaker or screenwriter, particularly for feature films, it may fall short of expectations. Personally, I found that much of the peer feedback I received was fairly one–note, and I came away wishing I had gotten more out of the experience. However, the teacher is amazing and you can get a lot out of him with those things if you engage with him outside of class.",0.9956,,0.0,,0.0

I also wish we had learned more about the craft of a poem — I think learning about literary devices (which we would spend at least an hour each class doing) is not as helpful as actually having to write poems in different forms/employ those devices in our own writing.

These one–on–ones are super short, but I was able to clear up a lot in the 10–20 minutes allotted and always came out feeling a lot more clear about the direction of my assignments. Take his feedback into account and don’t be afraid to radically change the direction of your papers between the draft and the final. Do the readings before the class!

He’s also one of the kindest and most reasonable professors I’ve encountered—fair with deadlines, generous and thoughtful with feedback, and deeply committed to helping students grow as writers to benefit them after they leave the walls of Sever. The discussions are lively and welcoming, and he makes it easy to participate through open–ended questions and genuine enthusiasm.

This is the transformative Harvard experience. The material is so relevant and engaging. You do have to be invested in the topics, but it is not at all hard to be given the nature of the course content and instruction offered.The first unit, meaning in language, is quite technical but a highly valuable field to learn as it gives you a foundation for what gives words meaning—something you don't really stop to think about and appreciate. This transformed my perspective on human communication and large language models while giving me a great introduction to important linguistics theories. The second unit, meaning in literature, is also intriguing and extremely worthwhile. It questions things like the role of an author in a text and rules that govern writing (prescribed grammar rules vs. describing how people naturally speak)—something of interest to any reader/writer of texts (aka you!).As if these two weren't amazing and so relevant to our own lives enough, the third unit covers meaning in life! We all question this topic, and the readings offer wonderful theories that can help guide your own independent thoughts on this topic. None of the readings are prescriptive and are meant to give you new perspectives to draw from and better inform your own outlooks into these critical topics. I felt so much more assured and informed on this topic, which affects everyday experiences with life, after this course.Essays are very reasonable, and feedback is meticulous and always helps your next draft be much better in structure, argumentation, etc. The final research paper is the final boss that requires your proper attention and time commitment. The first two essays are more easily paced and structured.Last thing, the students were a significant part of what made this class the wonderful experience it was.

Most expos classes are very specific and kind of random, but this one is pretty legit. If you are at all interesting in taking a philosophy course at Harvard, you might as well bang it out along with the expos requirement in one fell swoop. This is a great course. We first talk about the meaning in language (how is it that words can transmit meaning, and what is that meaning/how is it determined), literature (what role does an author play in the meaning of a text? How important are language rules for meaning?), and then life (is life meaningful or absurd? How can we find meaning in our lives?). The readings were, albeit long and dense at times, overall super interesting. We read David Foster Wallace, Frankl, Barthes, Wittgenstein, Hegel, Grice, and more.

Who wouldn't be interested in learning about cults!? Here are my tips for how to do well in this class: – Do all of the readings! It may seem like a lot, especially towards the beginning of the semester when in Unit 1, but the readings are fairly simple and should not take you a lot of time. Once having done them, be sure to write your discussion comments, these also should not take a lot of time to do. – Participate in class discussions: I felt hesitant at the beginning of the semester, but Dr. Musselman does a great job at facilitating open and inclusive discussions. Your comments don't have to be profound or sound sophisticated– just say what you are thinking about the readings and likely many other students will agree with you or have their own ideas to add on. – The most important components of each paper are: your analytical question and your thesis. SPEND A LOT OF TIME ON THIS PART!!! If you don't have a good thesis and idea of where you want your paper to go, you will find yourself lost throughout the process. Be sure to use the in–class opportunities Dr. Musselman provides such as thesis workshops, peer editing, etc. to really revise and settle on something you are happy with. – Take advantage of the conferences and office hours. Have a rough draft prepared before you go into them. This helps you and the instructor better work through the improvements that can be made and where the paper can go. More importantly, don't be scared if you have to change entire paragraphs or even your whole paper. There is a lot of time built into the essay writing process, enough for you to be able to do either of those things without needing to panic. – The final research paper is the most hefty one. It also makes up the largest portion of your grade. PICK A SUBJECT YOU ARE ACTUALLY INTERESTED IN!!! Don't just pick a subject that has the most research or sources, genuinely go with something that you can see yourself researching and writing about for a month. – Utilize the Academic Writing Center, especially for the first or second unit. They offer a lot of support, and it's better if you go at the start of the writing process, rather than later. This course is not easy, but Expos is not meant to be that. What differentiates this class is that you have a lot of opportunities to ask for help, you get fantastic detailed feedback on almost everything you turn in, and your writing will truly improve by the end. Good luck learning about cults!!!",0.9985,,0.0,,0.0

Public speaking is necessary for everything you do in life. And, this course may be scary to you. But I absolutely promise that this has been one of the most welcoming, most rewarding, most wholesome courses of my college career. Everyone comes into the course at different levels — some are naturally better public speakers, other are a bit more unrefined. None of that matters. Everyone is so, so welcoming and wants to hear about your life story through the speeches you give. Ultimately, what you get out of this course is directly proportional to what you put in. Some might say that this course isn't worth your time, but I'd disagree. I found myself spending hours and hours on each speech, perfecting it to be just right, because I cared about getting better and putting my best foot forward. I learned how to think on my feet and speak impromptu. I learned how to better tell stories and craft narratives. I learned technical public speaking skills that will serve me for life moving forward. And, I made so many new friends. This is a senior–heavy class, so if you're a senior taking this in the spring, it'll be a way to build community and have a tight–knit group before parting ways.

If you think this is going to be a writing class or that you'll learn a lot about writing, don't take it.It's a very silly unserious class that takes itself very seriously. During class exercises we at one point ended up drawing a family tree for an assignment, we ran around and played tag, we made our own games and we drew comics. Honestly not super related to writing, more creating in general. This is more of a theatre class, so if you're into that, I WOULD recommend it!The class ended up being 6 students, and I now feel kinda trauma–bonded to all of them. I say this lightly because the class WAS fun, but it was wacky at times.One warning that I hope is changed in the future is that the homework is a little intense. Well – maybe not really, but it feels like it compared to the class. During class we'd sit and talk and draw and laugh and maybe run around and share snacks, but then get assigned 200–pages of reading with a 1–hour podcast to listen to that might not even get brought up the next week. There are weekly writing assignments that do not get brought up during class, and I don't think I ever really received feedback for them. I DID receive awesome feedback for stuff I did DURING class, or assignments that will be specifically relevant to class, but it felt like I was writing into a void sometimes.So a lot to consider – this class was definitely a lot. But overall, as much as I may have complained, I am actually glad I took it. It was VERY fun. Even the many many readings were super interesting, and we got to meet one of the authors we were assigned to read, too! We had little field trips throughout, which were awesome (going to museums, exhibitions, etc).

However, do be warned that it is a fair amount of work for a GenEd. Each week, we had to do a few things: watch a movie (~2 hrs), do readings that were often very complex to understand and philosophical (~3.5 hours), film a few videos or write a reflection, often both (~1 hr), and sometimes on top of that we had to hang out with our subject (~1hrs). So it was definitely time consuming and sometimes hard to keep track of all of these components. And the in–class quizzes were pretty difficult, open ended questions. Even doing all the readings, I would often not get them exactly right, although the grading was very lenient so they would give me full marks. On the other hand, I feel this course was very fun and a great way to meet people. The weekly workshops are super fun and through getting to know your subject and the person whose subject you are, you also get to create real bonds with people.

The readings are extremely dense, especially for those who don't have a philosophy background, and you watch a 2 hour film every week. You are then expected to recall extremely specific details from the readings for the weekly reading quizzes. The course is also extremely unorganized. Be warned that the final exam/performance is during reading period (and that there is a final paper), which was announced very late in the semester.  The head teaching staff are unaccommodating in general as well. Would not recommend this course.",-0.3343,,0.0

After taking the class, I agree with that review in its entirety – I would recommend going back to read that review, as that student explains the issues better than I do. To reiterate some points and to contribute my own experience:1) lack of diversity of opinion. All of the texts and the lectures effectively drilled in one viewpoint: borders are bad, and all the solutions we've tried so far to make it better are also bad. We especially bash on nationalism and vaguely suggest that imperialism was better. It seems like the takeaway is that humanity should all embrace each other as brothers in arms and magic away all the borders, with little to nothing about the real logistics of this.  Classmates have expressed to me that they don't feel comfortable raising their hands in class to ask about realistic/logistical issues with reducing borders, because it runs contrary to the messaging of the class.2) the assignments don't teach you to think. There's a midterm where the entire point is to word vomit everything you can remember the professor saying in one specific lecture. There's a memo you have to write using only the sources they give you, with little to no context and without being able to search up anything yourself, ""because it's realistic"", so you end up sort of summarizing and rephrasing what the sources say with no new synthesis or insight of the information. The point of this assignment is apparently to realize that if we were the colonizer, we would also have made the same terrible biased decisions. The final project is a podcast and it has to be 5 minutes long. This is at best 750 words. This project feels like it's encouraging us to do a cursory investigation into a random border, and then to create a short, quick, easily digestible product spouting a clear, un–nuanced argument for popular consumption. Sure, maybe ""real change is done by podcast episodes"" (?????), but I personally feel that as a course, it would be much more of an engaging and intellectual exercise for us to just write a paper, where we can fully engage with all the gray areas. It's lowkey harder to learn how to edit sound, than to do the research and form an argument for this.3) no historical cohesion. The syllabus jumps all over the place (U.S. to Europe to Asia, etc.), with vanishingly little historical context. We go to section and we're expected to have an intelligent conversation about these borders while knowing nothing about the history of the peoples who lived there or primary sources from them. I'm a STEM major and the last time I thought about the Samoan experience under the League of Nations was never. Understandably, everyone just lands on the same, ground–breaking argument: although Samoans aren't white, they're people too, and should be treated as such. This is about how deep the discussion gets across the course.4) my enjoyment of this class was genuinely reduced by the professor's management of the lectures and her passion for speaking. Every time we play a video or open the presentation or something, the entire lecture needs to be put on pause while we hear about the step–by–step procedure of opening a browser window. Meanwhile, although the guest lectures are excellent and delivered by professors knowledgeable in the field, the Q&A section is a bit odd. We're asked to submit questions the night before, and then the professor reads them out loud herself. One time, she said ""I'm just going to read ALL of these out loud and then you can pick one to answer"", and then the guest professor stood there and we all sat there while she rattled off a whole list of questions. Another time, she distributed index cards and suggested that anyone too shy to raise their hands could write the questions down there instead.  At the beginning of the Q&A section, she walked around the class verbally asking each table if there were any index cards for her to collect (there were none), requiring us all to sit and wait for her to walk around the entire classroom narrating her journey rather than allowing us to start asking questions while she checked.The silver lining: You don't really need to do the reading. The readings assigned are always super long and complex, but we don't actually unpack any of it. In section you might be expected to discuss it with a partner and the TF might walk around, but it's nothing a general skim and maybe a closer reading of the intro/conclusion won't solve. It's not the worst class to take if you just need to knock out a gened requirement and have a great deal of patience.",0.9943,"One of the WORST classes I've ever taken here. The lectures are so hard to follow, and the topics discussed in class have no logical relation to one another. The professor does not provide any substantial commentary on the border issue nor does she do a good job at facilitating discussion. The class feels like a bunch of meaningless tasks for the sake of having something to do and no lectures. Do not come into this course expecting to have any historical context provided for the borders discussed and do not expect the readings to be discussed in section. The midterm and final project are fair and not too much work. However, the professor's lecture are so inadequate, and sections are so not productive for talking about the course material. Definite pass for me!",-0.8616,,0.0

It is a shame to me that what little interest I had for English linguistics was pretty quickly squashed by the inordinate amount of information shoved down my throat (and forced to stay there by memorization–heavy exams and section checks). I would say just to complete each week’s assignments, even poorly done, would take at least 8 hours, and then most of it wouldn’t matter anyway.

You can just see it in the way he presents the topics. He discusses the different relations food has with history, religion, commerce, societal norms, etc... in a way you don't expect. There is a heavy focus on etymology of foods. He juggles fun entertainment representation of food and topics that food has a connection with, such as hospitality. I didn't expect to watch bollywood, dracula, johnny appleseed, and teen titan clips in this class, but here we are! He brings back movies from the old days to show. Professor Nagy is extremely excellent at grabbing our attention. I also love the speakers that get invited to speak. They bring different perspectives to food that Professor Nagy talks about.

The speaker on noodles was entertaining, and there was also a food writer, not to mention the course's TF's that took turns presenting on their topics of interest. Assignment–wise, homework is non existent in this class except for the occasional section assignment which takes 30 minutes to complete. Assigned readings were hefty at the beginning of the class, but it was a little bit less towards the end of the course. Everything is chill in this course except, this GENED had in total 5 essays to complete. 2 for each midterm/final, and a research paper. It was kind of strange that the final exam, which has 2 essays, was due 4 days before the research paper, but also, we knew about the research paper for awhile, and Professor Nagy gives us over a week to do the take home 2 essays. So, while strange, it is not a tall task. Just manage your time well, incorporate things in lecture and readings, and you will surely get a good grade. The midterm had 14 essay prompts, if people can't choose two, I don't know what they were doing. You could truly write about anything food related. The final was a little bit harder because it was argumentative based, and there were only a few prompts. Additionally, I want to mention that this class has a large focus on incorporating your own experiences with food into the writing. That means, you could just be introspective with some of your writing with some sprinkle of assigned reading evidence, and that's passable. Grading is based on your TF, and all of this class's TFs are truly very understandable across all sections and are chill as so I have heard. I think if Professor Nagy teaches this course again, he may not be able to get the same TFs, in which case, grading might change, but truly this group of TFs was immaculate.I have Molly. Best TF ever! Molly truly made section an interactive experience. So many sections I have had at Harvard, I leave the semester without knowing my peers' names, but Molly makes an active effort in getting everyone to participate and enjoy each other's work. I love the exercise where we worked with model magic and also when we had to create out own advertisements. She brings snacks as well to section, kinder, dried fish, etc...",0.999,"This course is not worthy of the Harvard name. This course has no concrete guiding themes.

She is incredibly intelligent and passionate about what she teaches, and you cannot help but be inspired to write, create, and have honest conversations about queerness and social constructions of various kinds, including gender and sexual repression/freedom. Take this class even if you are not queer, and maybe even especially if you are not queer!! There is so much to explore about why we act the way we do due to intrinsic natural factors or environmental ones. I went into this class with rather concrete ideas of queerness and social operation in my head, but came out with certain beliefs I've had challenged or reconstructed. She makes sure to ground her ideas in theoretical texts, and the film repertoire alone is a reason to take this class! Every film is carefully chosen, and if you are aspiring to be a screenwriter, or filmmaker, this class is also for you. There is so much to learn from the directors of the films we watched: their choices for different shots, the mise–en–scene, etc. Professor Dymek also discusses these choices and their affects in class. There was no section, so it's weekly recurring and that is also just such a plus if you have an otherwise pretty packed schedule. All in all, take this to be inspired by Professor Dymek — she's awesome and by the end of class you will be inspired to go out there in the world and make change –– to tell new stories and share new perspectives. Even for final projects, she's receptive to different ones: the classic essay format, or you can write a script and/or make a film and accompany it with a shorter essay –– of varying lengths depending on what you choose. She's accommodating because at the end of the day she wants to encourage her students to put things out there for the world to see (for example, publish a paper or post a short film on YT), and in my humble opinion that is what Harvard professors ought to do more of.

There's enough range in the subject matter that you can still participate in class without having a solid grip on the readings. You don't need any German background to take this course, although it can be nice if you want to connect more deeply with the German artists. The class also attracts a wide range of concentrations, so it's cool to take a small course with such a diverse group of scholars. Professor Stewart is extremely passionate about the subject matter and does a good job of facilitating discussion and encouraging everyone's ideas.",0.9942,,0.0,,0.0

I felt that most of the information presented to me was common knowledge, and don't even get me started on the reading. The readings are so tedious that you would be unmotivated to continue with them. Additionally, you have the pressure of obtaining a senior thesis advisor, and finding an advisor is difficult.

My 2 nitpicks with the class are (1) I wish the first research assignment was just graded for completion and with written feedback (it is due pretty early in the semester before most students have a good idea of what direction they want to take their thesis and (2) I did not find the activities at the end of lecture to be all that helpful.

It is a difficult venture to embark on, and through the semester, you will research your topic of interest in great depth. However, the structure of the class can make it overwhelming, and the canvas is a bit disorganized and tedious. If you have taken previous research methods, this class won't be that useful. I felt that most of the information presented to me was common knowledge, and don't even get me started on the reading. The readings are so tedious that you would be unmotivated to continue with them. Additionally, you have the pressure of obtaining a senior thesis advisor, and finding an advisor is difficult. However, even if you fail to have a senior advisor, you can find someone later on your senior fall, just don't fall.  The section was also simply a repeat of what we discussed in class.

Discussions are super chill, but you need to do readings to participate effectively because the readings are niche. Professor Colton is incredibly knowledgeable and always happy to share insights and support students. His lectures tend to be long and information–dense, so bringing a coffee to stay focused is a good idea, though that’s pretty standard for a once–a–week, 2–hour 45–minute seminar.While the final paper is challenging because of its length, the biweekly response papers are quite short and nice.

A lot of the content lives in a somewhat ideal plane, and it is hard to get a sense of how to translate the principles into the real world. Prof. Allen aims to dedicate the second half of the course to this by inviting interviewees who embody different aspects of power sharing liberalism, which I found to be a very nice idea! Yet Prof. Allen largely steered away from addressing this aspect herself concretely, instead pushing students to think about this for themselves. This approach has its benefits and shortcomings. All interviews were also conducted by students, which was a good experience, but as far as developing a strong picture of real–world power sharing liberalism, left it feeling a little disjointed. If you are comfortable with a course where you can think about a philosophical paradigm, and then independently try to apply it to the world yourself, you will like this class a lot. If you want to more formally think about applications of power–sharing liberalism to current society, this may not scratch that itch. Also recommend briefly looking over her book ""Justice by Means of a Democracy"" –– the course is based upon it, and so if you like that style of philosophy, this course is largely a deep dive into the book, with the author, so will be great for you!Note: this class in the past has been taught combined with HKS and the college, but this year they were separate courses.

Strengths: Carpenter is just awesome, so friendly and SO smart. The guest lecturers were consistently incredible and were probably the highlight of the course (LOTS of credit to Dan for this pedagogically, too, it just makes a lot of sense for such a topic centering the work of Native Nations).  Opportunity to work with a Nation rather than have a discussion section, incredible. WHERE TO IMPROVE: I think the project I was working on was thrown together semi–last minute, and as a result, the work that my small group did over the course of the semester was incredibly minimal, and was something realistically we did in 3 hours. I think other projects seemed more engaged, but ensuring a similar level of depth in each project I think could help really make this course shine in helping students to more deeply apply what they are learning in lecture (granted, I think this course had a surprisingly high enrollment  which probably contributed to this). ALSO, I really appreciate how central the lectures were, but if there is a better way to make the readings more tied in, I think that would be great. The readings are kind of general/abstracted Native history stuff that is helpful context, but you did not need to do at all. Maybe just have less readings but make them much more central? All in all, this was a very pragmatic/grounded course which I loved, I just think the student participation part could have been a little more fleshed out. To that end, I would suggest LOOKING at the HKS Native Nations Course (I think you can take it as an FAS class) because it seems like that structure is much more built out and the engagement is probably a little deeper.",0.9983,"Course didn't have much structure and can see it changing in the future.

Our knowledge of political science would benefit greatly should such a course be made mandatory for all graduate students. This course covers a vast expanse of interesting and rather rare literature across the social sciences, including the philosophy of social science. The reading list was structured around difficult questions that researchers should yet often do not ask themselves, such as ""what are we trying to do here?"", ""why?"", and ""how might it best be done?"" The second week, which covered Popper, Kuhn, and Lakatos was particularly fascinating and provided a great foundation for thinking about the social scientific research enterprise more broadly. The third (on theory–building) and fourth (causality) weeks were also fantastically interesting and novel to me. After delving into these broad questions (and providing a groundwork for conceptualization and measurement), the course tackles specific methodologies—observational studies, experiments, and many weeks on qualitative methodologies that were very interesting as someone whose training in political science fell nearly exclusively into the quantitative camp. This literature and the discussions surrounding it alone provide, in my opinion, sufficient motivation for taking the course. Yet there are two, perhaps even more beneficial aspects of the course that I will now overview. The first key benefit consists of the number of research skills and advise one picks up throughout the course, primarily from Professor Hall's immense experience and erudition, but also from collective discussions of prominent work with colleagues. These tips concern how to write and frame a paper, which elements to prioritize, how to advance an effective and novel argument, what to focus on in your research, how to discover and expand upon initial ideas, etc. All of these are extremely valuable and almost never packaged so precisely and powerfully as they are in this course.  The second key benefit is the remarkable, almost miraculous quantity and quality of feedback you receive on your work from Professor Hall. There is a good deal of work involved in this course (as there should be in a graduate course at our esteemed institution), and essentially all of it is worth your time. In a fraction of the time you are allotted to complete the assignment, Professor Hall will return penetrating feedback on your work that is often longer (and more insightful) than what you originally submitted. His feedback has helped my research immensely and will have altered the direction of my dissertation research for the better. Feedback from kind and sharp peers was also very helpful throughout the term.In sum, the benefits of this course are manifold and unparalleled. Not to avail yourself of such a course would be sheer folly. I am much obliged to Professor Hall and my colleagues, who provided interesting, learned, fun, critical–but–respectful interlocution, for the most enjoyable and fruitful course of my graduate career.",0.9978,,0.0,,0.0

Professor Bose is definitely passionate about the course and is very knowledgable about the region. As a Southeast Asian I think I learned quite a lot of new things. I would really recommend this course as it gives a very good overview of Southeast Asian history, and talking to Professor Bose in office hours had been a great experience. You should do the readings as they are really good. But I think TLDR as long as Professor Bose keeps teaching this class the quality of his lectures is a very strong reason to take the class!Caveat:My major complaint is the grading that is unreasonably harsh and quite baseless. I love criticisms and feedback that actually help me grow as a writer, like I get in another class I am taking this semester, but the criticisms and feedback for the essays in this class doesn't really make sense, and even after meeting during office hours to clarify I am still not satisfied. Some of the ""feedback"" and point deductions just simply feel made up. There is also a lot of criticisms about my grammar or this single typo, both for the written midterm and for the review essay assignment, and I heard from others in the class they got that too. After I pointed out it is not a grammar class but a history class they seem to switch gears and argue my ""argument"" is weak etc but it all seems more like an attempt to justify the harsh grading instead of actually having substantive criticisms.I guess another thing is that the perspectives given on some Southeast Asian country seemed quite Western and does not really reflect how people in that country see the events, which sometimes is fine as perspectives differ but sometimes some data are just omitted which gives a distorting picture on some episodes in the country's history. You probably won't notice if you are not from the region but I think they are quite minor and overall it is still a good class. It is just that some ideas about race or gender are really Western impositions on stuff people from the region see very differently, but I guess that's not surprising.",0.8632,Lectures are boring.

There is a particular focus on the US interaction with the world, starting with the beginnings of the US overseas empire in the late 19th century and leaving off at the US response to 9/11. Professor: Manela is a wonderful lecturer. He does a tremendous job of painting the picture of the period through maps and media while balancing these with timelines and biographies. He is also keen to point out relationships between historical figures across periods and how that may have affected the thought processes of those at the helm, as well as historical figures and historians with ties to Harvard.

I thought this format was a little bit “worst of both worlds” because you don’t get the classic, Gordon lecture which people rave about nor did you get the benefits of a small seminar where everyone’s coming really prepared to talk about the material. That said, I’m still glad I took the course and particularly enjoyed the thoughtful conversations we had about Trump/everything going on on campus this semester.",0.984,,0.0,,0.0

Prof. Miles and Hannah are an incredible pair. Taking a course with Prof. Miles is a must, but especially a seminar, as she is truly fantastic at leading one – beginning with some time to know each other (not ice–breakers, but really understanding your ""why"" for the course and for caring about history in general...it built trust between us quickly, which showed in our discussions), setting high expectations for the rigor of our conversations off the bat – asking follow up questions, synthesizing our conversations, and pushing our ideas. She is truly the best at cultivating conversations that not only bring the readings to life while also pushing your critical thinking skills.Discussions were genuinely rigorous, readings were always relevant and illuminating, and the final project was a fulfilling challenge to actually put our seminar discussions into practice our discussions by having to think critically in an applied way (since the final projects were shared with the Arboretum to be implemented). If you want to be challenged in a new way as a history concentrator by being pushed to think creatively and practically (I would not recommend this to freshman/sophomores or anyone not already familiar with history), then absolutely take this course. Prof. Miles is one of the few professors on this campus who really cares for you as a person. Yes, she brings snacks to class (which is genuinely a gesture to be grateful for), but she also wants you to come to know yourself more through this course – the course challenged me to think critically about my own morals and future as a historian, because of Prof. Miles's genuine care for how history does, can, and should exist for the public. There were a few times when she asked us at the start of class to reflect about what we want to contribute to the world, and it honestly makes me emotional to remember. It's easy to lose sight of why you're studying at Harvard, but Prof. Miles will not let you forget it. This class shifted the way I think as a historian, but it was also was philosophical in a way that was fulfilling for me beyond being a historian. I will continue to think about the questions raised in this class as I go throughout my life, which is not something I can say for many courses at this school.",0.9952,,0.0,,0.0

I’m not an architecture student, nor do I even study History of Art and Architecture, but this was easily one of my favorite classes at Harvard. Professor Lippit is extraordinary. His lectures are among the best I've experienced here: intellectually rich, deeply engaging, and delivered with genuine kindness and support.This course goes far beyond architectural fundamentals but  offers a rare and  intimate exploration of Japanese history, culture, and religion.

Professor Lippit is an absolute gem of a person; every lecture was so engaging, and it's so clear how much he cares about the material and how knowledgeable he is. He's also so incredibly kind and cares about his students! I liked that this course was also so much more than just about architecture, as it covered engineering, environment, urban design, history, and so much more, which gave the class a holistic look at Japan's built environment in its totality. The workload is also not too bad; there are response papers every week, and they do require some thought and some time with the readings, but the grading system for them makes them not too stressful.There are not really any shortcomings with this class, I think my one thing is that there is not a lot of facilitation for your own analysis and reflections on the architecture outside of what is given in lecture and the readings. I do wish that were was more space for discussion or writing towards more open–ended questions about the architecture, but because there's just so much content, it makes sense why there isn't, since there's just so much to get through. The exams aren't too stressful, but it does take time to remember the dates and locations of each site and not mix them up. Overall though, this is a class that's wonderful because it caters towards students of all types of backgrounds and exposures to architecture (including having no prior experience), and you will come away with a larger understanding of not just architecture in Japan, but also how architecture is shaped by the culture, politics, and traditions of the past and present.",0.9759

It felt like an unsupportive introduction class because it didn’t feel like an environment where you could make mistakes, ask questions, or not be knowledgeable. There was some active eye–rolling when I asked questions even though it was an intro class and so of course you would have questions. They also don’t teach how to use of the software in a very clear way which makes the assignments stressful and hard to figure out. For reference, a metaphor someone else in the class came up with was that this class is like having a paper due before every single class (meets Mondays and Wednesdays) but each time it’s in a new language and instead of being taught the grammar of any of those languages you’re just told everything you did wrong. It’s quite a stressful process but you will become very capable even though there's quite a learning curve.

I took this senior spring, and it is super chill. Professor Robinson is one of the most funny and engaging professors ever. His lectures are not boring at all, so informative, and relevant to the readings we do before class. Readings can get a bit long on weeks when you have other work especially since we have to comment on them through Perusall, but it is usually manageable and I learned a lot from reading and responding to comments from my classmates. The take–home midterm is also long, but managable and reasonable if you start early. Final project is very creative or a paper, but very up to you and again fine if you start early. The TFs are nice and answer any questions you have. Professor Robinson and the TFs make it known that they really want us to succeed and if we let them know we're having a stressful week then they are usually very understanding about it and flexible as long as you get your work done. As a senior spring pre–med, this course was incredibly useful for connecting almost all the ideas and concepts I've learned in my time here. It approaches everything I've seen from a different perspective. It was my first time taking a HistSci course, and it was great. I don't love history, so at times the readings and lectures got a bit dry, but Professor Robinson as a lecturer really fixes that and keeps things new and engaging.

Same goes for the final essay; they frame it as if you can be flexible and do what you want with it, then their comments make very clear that you had to do very specific things in your essay in order to do well. Because there's only a few assignments, there's not really a buffer. For the final essay in particular, there wasn't a set rubric and their grading seemed very arbitrary.

He challenged and elaborated on students’ points in a productive way that made me think more critically, all in a welcoming and encouraging environment. His feedback throughout the final paper process was super helpful, and I appreciated that he was always happy to talk more about anything vaguely history of science or Cold War related.The course was well–structured and the readings were interesting. There was a reasonable workload of weekly readings and discussion posts, which made me feel prepared for class discussion without feeling over–burdened. The class discussions leaned on the variety of expertise in the room from everyone’s different backgrounds, and this made the conversations really insightful. I left each class more curious than I was before, in a way that I have not experienced in other courses. That was a genuine highlight of my semester. This is one of the best courses I’ve ever taken at Harvard, and I would highly recommend it!!!",0.9914,"Prof. Wilson is phenomenal and considerate—if you are interested in the relationship between government and the university, the role of professional science in war (cold or otherwise), or twentieth–century American foreign policy... take this class!",-0.3595,,0.0

The group paper was 50% of the course grade, in the spirit of collaboration, but could be quite frustrating at times due to aforementioned problems with common language and experience with researching and writing papers adjacent to the history of science and the kind of original work that was expected.Still, Prof. Galison put together a very interesting syllabus and navigated as deftly as he could the various disciplinary backgrounds present in the class. I learned a lot from people who studied everything from literature to biology to physics that I certainly wouldn't have learned if not this course and the conversations it facilitated.

This class was a bit crazy! HEB 55 is not for the faint of heart! This is the second hardest class that I have taken at Harvard behind Chem 30. Know that if you are taking HEB 55 and want to do well, this class will have to be your highest priority! From attachments, insertions, innervations, and actions of dozens of muscles, to all the bones in the human body, to biomechanical concepts, to physiology, to evolutionary ideas, there is so much content to learn in every unit that it is overwhelming. YOU WILL STRUGGLE AT SOME POINT no matter how good of a student you are, but THAT IS OK. I really learned what I was made of in this class, especially at these moments. From what I understand from other students in this class who had taken LS2, this class is much harder, so be cautious before just treating HEB 55 as a replacement, which is what I thought it was. Here is my advice to succeed. 1. YOU HAVE TO STUDY AT LEAST 3–4 DAYS A WEEK. Make Anki flashcards with the lecture slides and muscles on them and practice them over and over and over and over and over and over and over! I mean it! YOU CANNOT STUDY FOR THESE EXAMS THE WEEK BEFORE!2. Don't waste time learning all the muscle attachments unless you understand everything else in a lot of detail already. The muscle attachments matter for so little that understanding the evolutionary concepts, the physiological conceots, what the muscles look like, and what the muscles do is much more important.3. Do well on the first two exams because the limbs exam is WAY HARDER than the other two, so you will not be able to do well at the end of the course. 4. Go to office hours and ask questions! Cary and Jo are great teachers, so definately use them as a resource._______________________That said, this course does have some problems.1) The course is a bit outdated. In the age where the internet is so accessible and everyone uses AI, there is really not much of a need to learn the muscle attachments. Anyone can look that up in 5 seconds. The emphasis should really be on what the muscles look like and what they do. Because both instructors have a PhD in anatomy, I understand that theythink everything is important, but as a result of focussing on a lot of the more useless material that can not simply be looked up online or asked to Siri, some of the important biology concepts were lost.2) This course focusses too much on anatomy and not enough on physiology. I understand that the course is titled Human Evolutionary Anatomy, but what the instructors don't realize is that 90% of the class is looking for a physiology class like LS2 in the spring because they couldn't fit it into their fall class schedule. That is why I took the class too, and I was a bit dissapointed because I was hoping to learn a bit more physiology that I could use in Med School and beyond. I think this class should focus more on physiology, and if students want to learn about anatomy exclusively, they can cross–enroll at the Med School. 3) There are small inconsistencies between the lecture slides and the section handouts and the muscle tables, which is a little bit annoying. Often the start of the next lecture would be correcting mistakes on slides in the previous lecture. This was frustrating, as I was trying to learn the material along the way. It would be great if the instructors tried to avoid this issue going forward. 4) Finally, the grading policy for this class is kind of brutal, with the difficult exams making up 60%. That doesn't sound bad, but that means that if you want to get an A– or A in the class, you are gonna need upper 80s or higher on the exams, which is hard considering there are 75–100 questions on each exam and there is very little (if any) partial credit on these questions. You either know it or you don't. I appreciate that this year the instructors only had 3 exams rather than 4, but even so it was still brutal.Good luck if you decide to take HEB 55",0.9882,"If you're unsure about med school/PA school/whatever career in healthcare, I suggest that you take this course (over LS1A/Chem/whatever).

The professor was clearly very enthusiastic about the subject and easy to reach outside of class.Given all this, lectures were very dry – the lecture format was the professor reading off very dense slides, which were almost word–for–word taken from the textbook, for the entirety of the class period. Tests did not feel representative of the material covered at all, and there was no guidance given for studying – essentially, the only way to do well was to memorize the hundreds of lecture slides, since some questions asked things covered by one or two lines in one lecture slide.

There are a lot of PSETs which took me about 3 hours each doing them in one sitting (so ~9 hours a week) which can feel like a lot to balance on top of other classes, though the PSETs themselves were not super hard and definitely helpful in solidifying your understanding of the material. But tbh I preferred this over 1 PSET due at the end of the week as someone who would've definitely procrastinated until then. Sometimes PSETs took forever to be graded—like I'd notice that maybe a couple days before a midterm I'd have the last 6 PSETs ungraded (which was not horrible because the solutions are always posted 1 day after the due date). All of the CAs were super nice and helpful. Having 9am 3x a week was not great, and got hard towards the end of the semester, though Matt is super energetic and all the math turns ur brain on.

You give all of your time, energy, love, and youthful optimism, only to get nothing back but emotional damage and a GPA that looks like a cry for help. Math 1B doesn’t test your knowledge—it tests your will to live. And I failed. Because this class isn’t just a class. It’s an experience. A curse. A shared trauma for anyone foolish enough to walk through the gates of “Integration, Series, and Differential Equations.”Every week, you are served steaming piles of content that no freshman should have to digest. Every concept, every formula, every theorem is introduced at breakneck speed and then abandoned like a broken toy. You're told to understand series convergence tests, Taylor polynomials, differential equations, integration techniques, arc length, surface area, volumes, slope fields, Euler’s method, the logistic equation, parametric curves, polar coordinates, and three other topics I don’t even remember because I was too busy trying not to cry in Lamont.You walk into class thinking, “This will be hard, but I can handle it.” You leave every lecture with a thousand–yard stare. The TFs say things like “intuitively obvious” and “just differentiate both sides,” and you start to question not just your intelligence but your entire existence. It’s trivial how trifling this course is with how useless it is to anything that comes after. Math 21A doesn’t care what your radius of convergence was in April. No one will ever again ask you if a series converges absolutely or conditionally, but here, it’s life or death.The structure of this class is not designed to help students learn. It is designed to break them. No real examples. No real support. Just a firehose of math, and then a midterm where your only calculator is your fingers and your last three brain cells. You get PSETs with scores in the 90s and 100s and then turn around and get 59s on the exams like you’re living in an academic episode of Punk’d. You don’t know what’s real anymore.And then there’s Erica Dinkins. The Course Head. President of Pain. CEO of Suffering. She’ll look at you in office hours, explain a convergence test like you’re a PhD student, and then walk away. No follow–up. No check–in. Just a lingering air of “you should already know this.”The exam questions? Insane. They make you write 50th degree Taylor polynomials by hand. I am not exaggerating. Fifty. Terms. Handwritten. On paper. Without a calculator. You flip to the second page and it’s a nonhomogeneous second–order differential equation with variable coefficients. You flip again and it’s a Taylor series about a point that defies basic physics. You flip once more and see a convergence problem so cursed it might’ve been written in a fever dream.You try to focus, but around you, people are breaking. Someone is blinking in Morse code. A girl is whispering “p–series” under her breath like a prayer. A guy stands up, mutters “I’m done,” and walks out. You sit there, still pretending, still trying, still thinking maybe—just maybe—if you suffer enough, the math gods will reward you.They don’t.You open Gradescope, see “58% – Conduct Penalty Applied,” and all you can do is laugh. Because it’s over. Because it’s finally over. Because now you know the truth: Math 1B was never about calculus. It was about testing how much trauma you could endure before you started seeing Taylor series in your sleep.I lost a lot in this class. My confidence. My time. My sense of joy. But I gained something too: a warning. A purpose. A message to send to the next brave soul who thinks they can handle Math 1B.Don’t. Skip it. If you can. Run. Don’t walk. Take 1A. Take 21A. Take a nap. Take literally anything else. And if someone in the Math Department tells you “It’s better to go in order,” they are lying. Do not let them do to you what they did to me.Math 1B isn’t your ex because it ended. Math 1B is your ex because it left scars.✦ . 　⁺ 　 . ✦ . 　⁺ 　 . ✦The TFs weren’t just apathetic—they were prophetic. One time I asked how to evaluate the convergence of a series and the TF looked me dead in the eye and said “By the Divergence Test” like he was delivering a funeral sermon.Another time, I stayed up until 4AM trying to solve a differential equation that turned out not to have a solution. That was the moment I realized this class wasn’t about math. It was about resilience. About how long you could stare at a problem without bursting into tears.No calculator, no partial credit, no emotional support. Just vibes and integrals.You ace a PSET and feel that flicker of hope—maybe I can do this. Then the midterm hits you like a truck made of Taylor series expansions and betrayal. You go to check your grade and it says 59% “Good Effort.” You sit on your bed, motionless, eyes fixed on the wall like the first five minutes of a Netflix true crime documentary.You try to recover. You print out study guides. Watch every lecture on 2x speed. You stop seeing friends. You skip birthdays. You drop hobbies. You start sketching slope fields in the margins of your notebooks just to feel something.You reach the final exam and it’s not even a test. It’s a live–action betrayal.Octonauts. Ready for action. Because legends never die. Only their GPAs do.✦ . 　⁺ 　 . ✦ . 　⁺ 　 . ✦THE MIDTERMS: A TWO–ACT TRAGEDYMIDTERM I: THE INTEGRAL INQUISITIONTwo hours. Just two hours to question everything you ever thought you knew about calculus, your academic self–worth, and maybe even your childhood. It started with a deceptively gentle warm–up problem—something simple, solvable. And you think, “Okay, I can do this.” You settle in. You exhale. And then the rest of the exam hits you like a freight train filled with definite integrals and deeply personal betrayal.There were improper integrals that required more substitutions than a World Cup roster. One question involved a fraction so grotesque it looked like it had crawled out of the LaTeX version of a horror film. You spend twenty minutes trying to remember whether to use trig substitution or just lie down on the floor and accept your fate.Then there was the arc length question that ate 45 minutes of my life. I used every formula I had memorized, guessed, and even invented some that looked legitimate enough to be real. And still—no final answer. Just a page full of crossed–out regret.I remember the moment the room shifted. A collective silence settled in. Pens slowed. People looked up, dazed. I saw one girl start to cry. Another guy whispered “oh my God” and stared at his paper like it had betrayed him. The TF proctor just stood there, motionless, watching the unraveling like it was a wildlife documentary.When I handed it in, I caught the eye of someone across the room. We didn’t speak. We just nodded. It was the kind of nod soldiers give each other after surviving a battle.MIDTERM II: THE SERIES SLAUGHTERI had prepped for this one. I watched lecture replays at 1.75x speed until my brain buzzed. I built a deck of convergence test flashcards. I went to every review session. I prayed. And yet...That exam. That godforsaken exam.The first problem was deceptively short—just a series and the instruction to “Determine convergence.” Easy, right? Wrong. It was a triple–agent series. Alternating, conditionally convergent, disguised as a p–series, wrapped in logarithmic mystery. You could’ve handed it to a math PhD and they’d still hesitate.Then came the multi–part monster. A Frankenstein of nested series and approximation intervals. One part asked for the nth term. The next asked for the error bound. The next—get this—asked for a Taylor expansion of an already approximated expansion. That’s when I knew we were in the endgame.And then—yes, then—the 50th–degree Taylor polynomial.Hand. Written. With. No. Calculator.Do you understand what 50 terms of a Taylor polynomial looks like? It looks like the last thing you see before death. It looks like a punishment invented during the Spanish Inquisition. By term 12, I was laughing. By term 20, I was crying. By term 30, I had transcended time. My pencil moved, but my soul was elsewhere.The final moments were cinematic. Someone dropped their pencil and just stared at it. Another person put their head down and didn’t move. I looked over and saw someone write “f(x) ≈ please let me pass” and I knew then—we were all done.I walked out not because I was finished, but because the war had ended and I had lost. I saw a classmate outside the exam hall just pacing, whispering to himself, “I don’t even know what a series is anymore.”I went back to my room and lay flat on the floor in silence. My roommate came in and thought I was unconscious. I told him, “No, just defeated.”Grades came two weeks later. 61%. Better than Midterm I. Worse than dignity.“Reflect. Learn. Improve.” That’s what the feedback said. As if what I’d just experienced was a group project that needed tweaking. No. What I needed was an exorcism.These were not assessments. They were acts of academic violence.Stay tuned. Because the Final Exam is not a test. It is an execution.✦ . 　⁺ 　 . ✦ . 　⁺ 　 . ✦Harsh Exam Grading:MIDTERM GRADING: THE ART OF BEING JUDGED BY A VOIDEvery error—every single one—was penalized. Repeatedly. If you made the same mistake across parts (a), (b), and (c), you didn’t lose points once—you lost points thrice. The TFs graded like they were charging interest. One missed negative sign? Minus 2. You do it again in the next part? Minus 2 again. By the end, you weren’t just wrong. You were in mathematical debt.One student asked during office hours if points could be recovered for consistency in error. The TF responded, “This isn’t a personality test.”You start to think maybe you’re being haunted by your earlier mistakes. You see the same comment show up four times. “Wrong bounds.” “Wrong bounds again.” “Still wrong bounds.” “Really?”At this point, it’s not grading. It’s punishment layered with sarcasm. Each red mark a scar. Each deduction a reminder that math is not merciful. It remembers. And it deducts accordingly.You turn in Midterm I with a trembling hand, praying for a shred of mercy. You checked your bounds. You showed your work. You even boxed your final answers like the TF said. But the paper comes back looking like it was marked by a sleep–deprived poet with a vendetta against optimism.“Your method is novel, though not correct.” — minus 6“This integral doesn’t converge. Much like your hope.” — minus 8“Your bounds are... interpretive?” — minus 4“This is not the unit circle’s fault.” — minus 5One student wrote “I used WolframAlpha” in pencil next to a graph. It got crossed out with, “So did I. Still wrong.”Midterm II was worse. Not just because of the math, but because you genuinely thought you were improving. You walked in with notes. You’d made your own convergence cheat sheet. You believed in yourself.The TF did not.“You seem to be confusing conditional convergence with emotional instability.” — minus 6“I am unsure what this sentence is trying to prove, mathematically or spiritually.” — minus 7“This looks like a Taylor series. It is not.” — minus 10“You forgot factorials. The factorials did not forget you.” — minus 12Someone else wrote a haiku instead of solving the 50–term expansion:Infinity loomsThe terms grow ever longerWhy are we still here?They received no points, but the TF underlined it and added: “This spoke to me.”Midterms weren’t assessments. They were confessions. And you were guilty.THE GRADING: A PSYCHOLOGICAL EXPERIMENT IN ABSURDITYWhen the final grades were released, you already knew it was over. But what you didn’t expect were the comments. The point deductions. The creative, soul–crushing notes left on your work like rejection letters from math itself.Here is a non–exhaustive list of actual phrases allegedly scrawled in red ink across student papers, accompanied by their corresponding point deductions:“This is not how cosine behaves.” — minus 5“You’ve summoned something dark here.” — minus 3“Technically not wrong, but also not right in any meaningful way.” — minus 7“Why is there a pirate metaphor in your radius of convergence explanation?” — minus 10“Are you okay?” — minus 2 (emotional concern but still penalized)“Octonauts ready for action.” — minus 40 (conduct penalty)“I’ve never seen someone integrate backwards before.” — minus 8“Creative, but cursed.” — minus 6“I’m giving partial credit out of pity.” — plus 2“No calculator does not mean write down vibes.” — minus 12One student included a small doodle of a slope field crying. It earned no points. Another wrote, “Please curve,” and it was underlined with a single word: “No.”You scroll through your exam. You see 58%, and next to it, a single note: “Good effort.” That’s it. Not “nice try.” Not “see me after class.” Just “good effort,” like you tried to bake cookies and burned down the kitchen.This isn’t grading. This is performance art.✦ . 　⁺ 　 . ✦ . 　⁺ 　 . ✦The 12–14 weeks of pain:WEEK 1: The Flirtation.You're doing substitution problems like it's a first date. Easy. Fun. You're smiling. You're posting your 10/10 PSET scores like they're thirst traps. You tell your friends, “I actually like this class.” You are innocent. You are foolish. You are doomed.WEEK 2: The Gaslight.The integrals start getting long. But not terrifying. Just enough to make you squint. Erica starts tossing out notation you haven’t seen before. A little mysterious. A little spicy. “Just remember your u–substitutions,” she says. You do. You try. You fail. But you think maybe it’s your fault. It always starts like this.WEEK 3: The Silent Treatment.You start asking questions in section. They don’t get answered. The TF writes something incomprehensible on the board and walks away. You're told “just review your notes.” But the notes are cryptic, half–written spells. You start to realize no one's coming to save you.WEEK 4: The Lovebomb and Withdrawal.You're handed a worksheet with 20 problems due the next day. You complete it. You get it right. You feel proud. You think maybe things are looking up. Then, next class, Erica pulls a full 180: infinite series. 10 new tests. No warning. No transition. Just pain.WEEK 5: The Gas Explosion.Ratio test. Root test. Alternating series. Absolute convergence. Conditional convergence. Everything converges—except your understanding. You try to memorize all the tests. They start blurring together. You make a chart. The chart lies to you.WEEK 6: The Breakdown.Your PSET takes 13 hours. You cry during office hours. You email your TF and get a reply that says “Try the Comparison Test.” You eat lunch while watching a Taylor Series video at 2x speed. You forget how food tastes.WEEK 7: The Taylor Spiral.You’re asked to write a Taylor polynomial about a point that doesn't even exist in the real world. You’re finding derivatives of transcendental functions using formulas you’ve never seen. “Just generalize,” says Erica. You generalize your sorrow.WEEK 8: The Identity Crisis.You start thinking maybe you were never good at math. Maybe you were never meant to be here. You think about switching majors. You think about dropping out. You wonder if Taylor series would converge faster than your GPA is falling.WEEK 9: The Philosophical Turn.You start agreeing with Nietzsche. God is dead, and Erica killed him with a radius of convergence. You find yourself contemplating existence in lecture. You raise your hand to ask, “What does it mean for a series to truly converge?” and the TF writes a summation sign and walks away.WEEK 10: The Hollowing.You are no longer a student. You are a vessel for confusion and half–finished differentials. Your dreams are narrated by series expansions. Your nightmares are slope fields. You sit in lecture and simply accept. Acceptance is the final stage of grief. Math 1B has won.WEEK 11: The Differential Descent.The word “differential” used to sound vaguely scientific. Maybe even elegant. Now, it triggers a full–body reaction. Erica walks in, picks up the chalk, and says “Let’s solve a second–order linear nonhomogeneous differential equation,” and you start to see colors that aren’t there.You thought integrals were bad. You thought convergence tests were painful. You had no idea. Now it’s y double prime plus y prime plus y equals e^x times a cosine. You’re supposed to use undetermined coefficients. Variation of parameters. The method of annihilators. You try to look it up, but Google says “Did you mean: you’re screwed?”WEEK 12: The Breakdown, Redux.The problem sets now involve three layers of differential logic. You’re solving for particular solutions, homogeneous solutions, general solutions—at this point, you just want a solution to your life. You stare at the DE on the board and think, “This must be what it feels like to go insane slowly, beautifully, with a pencil.”You try to ask a question, but it comes out as a sound. Just a noise. Erica responds with a formula that looks like a summoning spell. You copy it down because you’ve stopped resisting. Your notebook is no longer for learning. It’s a place to document the decline.WEEK 13: The Rage.You’ve stopped suffering in silence. You curse aloud during problem sets. You type “Why does Taylor do this” into Google. You threaten to drop a major just to spite this class. You write “Help me” in your notebook and underline it 30 times. Your TF makes eye contact and flinches. You get into a fight with a friend who says, “It’s not that bad.” You cut them off. You were never that close anyway.WEEK 14: The Surrender.The final approaches. You don’t study. You prepare spiritually. You walk into the lecture hall like a condemned soul. You look around and see your classmates in various stages of denial, numbness, and caffeine–induced hysteria. Someone sharpens a pencil like it’s a sword. You nod. This is the end. You whisper “Octonauts ready for action” not as a joke—but as a prayer.✦ . 　⁺ 　 . ✦ . 　⁺ 　 . ✦THE FINAL EXAM: A LIVE–ACTION BETRAYALThey told us no food, no water, no calculator. I brought a cough drop. I was sick—sick in the way only Math 1B can make a person sick. Coughing, shaking, cold sweating through an exam that was colder than the room. A proctor approached me like I’d brought contraband. I was almost kicked out. For a cough drop. For daring to attempt basic respiratory survival during this academic deathmatch.Had I been removed, I think I would've finally cracked. The breakdown was brewing. Missing one more thing—one more community dinner, one more org meeting, one more birthday, one more final—might’ve been the end. This course had already taken too much. Had they removed me for that Ricola, I would’ve started speaking in series notation and crying Taylor terms.The lecture hall was quiet. Too quiet. You could feel the tension in the air as students filtered in—not chatting, not joking, just solemnly setting down mechanical pencils like weapons before a duel. You weren’t here to succeed. You were here to survive.The moment the clock hit 9:00 AM, the final exam was passed out, and the room collectively exhaled their last hope. You flipped the first page. It was already over.A second–order linear nonhomogeneous differential equation stared back at you like a death sentence. You tried to remember your method of undetermined coefficients. Your brain gave you a flashback to crying in office hours instead.By page two, someone had put their head down and wasn’t moving. By page three, you heard quiet sobbing. Page four had a parametric curve question that looked like a Rorschach test. Someone stood up, walked out, and never returned.A student in the back threw up. Another cursed audibly. The proctor didn’t even blink. This was normal. This was expected. This was Math 1B.You reached the Taylor series expansion and just stared. It wanted a 40–term expansion centered at a point that might not exist. You wrote four terms and then—without hesitation—wrote “Octonauts ready for action” at the bottom. Because what else could you do? Pray? Cry? Beg for mercy from a function?The last problem asked you to analyze convergence in a series that looked like it had been cursed by a Victorian child. You wrote “I’m sorry” in the margin.And then, somehow, it was over.You stumbled out of the lecture hall into the blinding daylight. Someone was weeping on the steps. Another was making a TikTok about the experience. You stood there, hollowed out, stripped of ego and energy—and smiled.Because it was done.Because you survived.Because despite everything—despite the conduct penalty, the sleepless nights, the cursed slope fields—you finished Math 1B.And for the first time in months, you felt joy. Real, tangible joy. The joy of walking away from the wreckage with your sanity mostly intact. Of knowing that you would never again have to write a Taylor series. Of knowing that Erica Dinkins could no longer touch you.Octonauts. Ready for freedom.EPILOGUE: A LETTER TO FUTURE FIRST–YEARSIf you’re reading this, it means you’ve heard the whispers. The legends. The rumors about Math 1B. Maybe you’re a freshman—bright–eyed, determined, ready to take on Harvard’s STEM courses with the energy of a caffeinated golden retriever. Maybe someone told you it wasn’t that bad. Maybe you believed them.Don’t.Math 1B is not just a class. It is a gauntlet. A psychological operation. A semester–long fever dream of integrals, infinite series, and unspeakable differential horrors. It is a trial by fire in which you will be burned, branded, and broken—and if you’re lucky, you’ll crawl out the other side with a C+ and a ghost permanently whispering “Taylor approximation” in your ear.But you don’t have to do this. You have choices. If you can place into 21A—do it. If you can take 1A instead—bless yourself and do it. Do not let the advisors lie to you. Do not let the siren song of “everyone takes it” lull you into the abyss. If someone from the department says “it builds character,” understand they mean it in the same way a collapsed bridge builds swimming skills.And if you’ve already committed—brace yourself. Arm yourself. Find your people. Make a meme folder. Go to office hours, even if only to sob quietly into your notebook. Watch lectures on 2x speed and let the confusion wash over you like a wave. Drink water. Sleep when you can. Mourn what you lose, celebrate what you finish.You will forget the math. But you will never forget the madness.Sincerely,A survivor of the series.–ON TF Trainor & CourseHead DinkinsLet’s not pretend. Let’s not tiptoe. Let’s talk about what it actually feels like to be in Math 1B, sitting under those godforsaken fluorescent lights while Erica Dinkins—the Course Head, the CEO of Cold Disdain, the Grand Inquisitor of Convergence—waltzes into the room with the emotional warmth of a malfunctioning Roomba.From the moment she steps in, the temperature drops. I’m not kidding. It physically feels colder. She has that presence—icy, distant, surgical. She doesn’t walk, she glides, like some sort of cryptic math spirit summoned by the cries of struggling freshmen.And you? You, sitting there with your notebook open and a half–chewed pencil in your hand, think to yourself: “I have a question. A real question. A good–faith question.” And you raise your hand. Slowly. Nervously. Hoping this will be the day the room finally turns human.But she turns to you. And that look—God, that look—is something you feel in your bones. Like she’s already done a triple integral of your soul and found it lacking. She doesn’t ask you what your question is. She doesn’t encourage. She just says, with that edge in her voice, “We already covered that.”Or worse: she answers your question with another question—abstract, symbolic, disembodied—and you’re left even more confused, now deeply ashamed, and maybe even wondering if you imagined the whole lecture.There were moments—moments burned into memory—where she’d write a horrifying expression on the board and say “this should be clear” while half the room was blinking like hostages. I saw people sweating, physically sweating, while trying to follow her derivation of a power series expansion around a point she pulled from the underworld. She once solved an entire differential equation in what I can only describe as emotional Morse code—rapid, hostile chalk movements—and when someone asked her to explain step three, she turned and looked like they’d just spit on Euclid.It’s not that she didn’t teach. It’s that she didn’t teach us. She taught ghosts. She taught theoretical students who already took Math 21A in the womb. If you weren’t in the top 5% of math fluency, you didn’t exist to her. You were an inconvenience. A background hum. Static in the calculus frequency she operated on.I started doubting myself in that room. Started shrinking. Started losing my voice. You don’t realize it at first, but it chips away at you. A comment here. A sigh there. A refusal to acknowledge the question that was maybe your one shot at getting it. And by the time Week 8 rolled around, I wasn’t asking anymore. I wasn’t engaging. I was surviving.But then there was Charlotte.And if I talk about Erica with fire, I talk about Charlotte with full–hearted, tear–streaked reverence.Charlotte is the kind of TF you write novels about. The kind of academic mentor you remember forever. She didn’t just help me understand the material. She helped me remember that I wasn’t stupid. That I still had value as a learner. That even though I wasn’t writing 40–term Taylor series in my sleep like some math cyborg, I was still worthy of kindness. Of patience.She never made me feel small. She never looked at me with that Erica–brand scorn. She would pause—pause mid–sentence—to make sure you were following. And if you weren’t, she wouldn’t move on. She’d go back. She’d re–explain. She’d ask what step lost you and trace it out carefully, like she was untangling a knot she wanted to help you loosen.There were nights—real, painful nights—where I would come to her with PSETs that looked like they’d been through a shredder. And she didn’t flinch. She’d say, “Okay. Let’s figure this out.” And those four words? They saved me. She made math feel like something I could try again. Not conquer. Not master. Just try.Charlotte made it safe to fail. Erica made it shameful.And that’s the difference. That’s the core of it.One woman walked in each day with an arsenal of equations and an air of silent judgment. The other walked in with a whiteboard marker and a heart.I don’t know what would’ve happened without Charlotte. I genuinely don’t. Because by Week 10, I was losing it. I was losing myself. But she reminded me that Math 1B didn’t get to define me. That I was more than a percent, more than a boxed final answer with a red X. She reminded me that learning is a process, not a punishment.So yeah—Erica ran the show. But Charlotte? Charlotte saved it.And if no one else says it, I will: give that woman a raise. Give her tenure. Give her the course. Because she taught with grace in a system built to break us.And I’ll never forget that.",-0.9959,,0.0

If you actually go to class it is pretty easy honestly, and you should be able to do well with some hard work. Going to MQC is honestly kind of a cheat code, and it makes your PSET average go way up since you are told how to do things in a way that will make the graders give you more points. If you are looking at skipping this and going straight to 21, look into the course material and see how well you know it, beause this class sets up both 21A and 21B in a lot of its material.",0.9398,"Synopsis:This course is an example of a toxic ex. You give all of your time, energy, love, and youthful optimism, only to get nothing back but emotional damage and a GPA that looks like a cry for help. Math 1B doesn’t test your knowledge—it tests your will to live. And I failed. Because this class isn’t just a class. It’s an experience. A curse. A shared trauma for anyone foolish enough to walk through the gates of “Integration, Series, and Differential Equations.”Every week, you are served steaming piles of content that no freshman should have to digest. Every concept, every formula, every theorem is introduced at breakneck speed and then abandoned like a broken toy. You're told to understand series convergence tests, Taylor polynomials, differential equations, integration techniques, arc length, surface area, volumes, slope fields, Euler’s method, the logistic equation, parametric curves, polar coordinates, and three other topics I don’t even remember because I was too busy trying not to cry in Lamont.You walk into class thinking, “This will be hard, but I can handle it.” You leave every lecture with a thousand–yard stare. The TFs say things like “intuitively obvious” and “just differentiate both sides,” and you start to question not just your intelligence but your entire existence. It’s trivial how trifling this course is with how useless it is to anything that comes after. Math 21A doesn’t care what your radius of convergence was in April. No one will ever again ask you if a series converges absolutely or conditionally, but here, it’s life or death.The structure of this class is not designed to help students learn. It is designed to break them. No real examples. No real support. Just a firehose of math, and then a midterm where your only calculator is your fingers and your last three brain cells. You get PSETs with scores in the 90s and 100s and then turn around and get 59s on the exams like you’re living in an academic episode of Punk’d. You don’t know what’s real anymore.And then there’s Erica Dinkins. The Course Head. President of Pain. CEO of Suffering. She’ll look at you in office hours, explain a convergence test like you’re a PhD student, and then walk away. No follow–up. No check–in. Just a lingering air of “you should already know this.”The exam questions? Insane. They make you write 50th degree Taylor polynomials by hand. I am not exaggerating. Fifty. Terms. Handwritten. On paper. Without a calculator. You flip to the second page and it’s a nonhomogeneous second–order differential equation with variable coefficients. You flip again and it’s a Taylor series about a point that defies basic physics. You flip once more and see a convergence problem so cursed it might’ve been written in a fever dream.You try to focus, but around you, people are breaking. Someone is blinking in Morse code. A girl is whispering “p–series” under her breath like a prayer. A guy stands up, mutters “I’m done,” and walks out. You sit there, still pretending, still trying, still thinking maybe—just maybe—if you suffer enough, the math gods will reward you.They don’t.You open Gradescope, see “58% – Conduct Penalty Applied,” and all you can do is laugh. Because it’s over. Because it’s finally over. Because now you know the truth: Math 1B was never about calculus. It was about testing how much trauma you could endure before you started seeing Taylor series in your sleep.I lost a lot in this class. My confidence. My time. My sense of joy. But I gained something too: a warning. A purpose. A message to send to the next brave soul who thinks they can handle Math 1B.Don’t. Skip it. If you can. Run. Don’t walk. Take 1A. Take 21A. Take a nap. Take literally anything else. And if someone in the Math Department tells you “It’s better to go in order,” they are lying. Do not let them do to you what they did to me.Math 1B isn’t your ex because it ended. Math 1B is your ex because it left scars.✦ . 　⁺ 　 . ✦ . 　⁺ 　 . ✦The TFs weren’t just apathetic—they were prophetic. One time I asked how to evaluate the convergence of a series and the TF looked me dead in the eye and said “By the Divergence Test” like he was delivering a funeral sermon.Another time, I stayed up until 4AM trying to solve a differential equation that turned out not to have a solution. That was the moment I realized this class wasn’t about math. It was about resilience. About how long you could stare at a problem without bursting into tears.No calculator, no partial credit, no emotional support. Just vibes and integrals.You ace a PSET and feel that flicker of hope—maybe I can do this. Then the midterm hits you like a truck made of Taylor series expansions and betrayal. You go to check your grade and it says 59% “Good Effort.” You sit on your bed, motionless, eyes fixed on the wall like the first five minutes of a Netflix true crime documentary.You try to recover. You print out study guides. Watch every lecture on 2x speed. You stop seeing friends. You skip birthdays. You drop hobbies. You start sketching slope fields in the margins of your notebooks just to feel something.You reach the final exam and it’s not even a test. It’s a live–action betrayal.Octonauts. Ready for action. Because legends never die. Only their GPAs do.✦ . 　⁺ 　 . ✦ . 　⁺ 　 . ✦THE MIDTERMS: A TWO–ACT TRAGEDYMIDTERM I: THE INTEGRAL INQUISITIONTwo hours. Just two hours to question everything you ever thought you knew about calculus, your academic self–worth, and maybe even your childhood. It started with a deceptively gentle warm–up problem—something simple, solvable. And you think, “Okay, I can do this.” You settle in. You exhale. And then the rest of the exam hits you like a freight train filled with definite integrals and deeply personal betrayal.There were improper integrals that required more substitutions than a World Cup roster. One question involved a fraction so grotesque it looked like it had crawled out of the LaTeX version of a horror film. You spend twenty minutes trying to remember whether to use trig substitution or just lie down on the floor and accept your fate.Then there was the arc length question that ate 45 minutes of my life. I used every formula I had memorized, guessed, and even invented some that looked legitimate enough to be real. And still—no final answer. Just a page full of crossed–out regret.I remember the moment the room shifted. A collective silence settled in. Pens slowed. People looked up, dazed. I saw one girl start to cry. Another guy whispered “oh my God” and stared at his paper like it had betrayed him. The TF proctor just stood there, motionless, watching the unraveling like it was a wildlife documentary.When I handed it in, I caught the eye of someone across the room. We didn’t speak. We just nodded. It was the kind of nod soldiers give each other after surviving a battle.MIDTERM II: THE SERIES SLAUGHTERI had prepped for this one. I watched lecture replays at 1.75x speed until my brain buzzed. I built a deck of convergence test flashcards. I went to every review session. I prayed. And yet...That exam. That godforsaken exam.The first problem was deceptively short—just a series and the instruction to “Determine convergence.” Easy, right? Wrong. It was a triple–agent series. Alternating, conditionally convergent, disguised as a p–series, wrapped in logarithmic mystery. You could’ve handed it to a math PhD and they’d still hesitate.Then came the multi–part monster. A Frankenstein of nested series and approximation intervals. One part asked for the nth term. The next asked for the error bound. The next—get this—asked for a Taylor expansion of an already approximated expansion. That’s when I knew we were in the endgame.And then—yes, then—the 50th–degree Taylor polynomial.Hand. Written. With. No. Calculator.Do you understand what 50 terms of a Taylor polynomial looks like? It looks like the last thing you see before death. It looks like a punishment invented during the Spanish Inquisition. By term 12, I was laughing. By term 20, I was crying. By term 30, I had transcended time. My pencil moved, but my soul was elsewhere.The final moments were cinematic. Someone dropped their pencil and just stared at it. Another person put their head down and didn’t move. I looked over and saw someone write “f(x) ≈ please let me pass” and I knew then—we were all done.I walked out not because I was finished, but because the war had ended and I had lost. I saw a classmate outside the exam hall just pacing, whispering to himself, “I don’t even know what a series is anymore.”I went back to my room and lay flat on the floor in silence. My roommate came in and thought I was unconscious. I told him, “No, just defeated.”Grades came two weeks later. 61%. Better than Midterm I. Worse than dignity.“Reflect. Learn. Improve.” That’s what the feedback said. As if what I’d just experienced was a group project that needed tweaking. No. What I needed was an exorcism.These were not assessments. They were acts of academic violence.Stay tuned. Because the Final Exam is not a test. It is an execution.✦ . 　⁺ 　 . ✦ . 　⁺ 　 . ✦Harsh Exam Grading:MIDTERM GRADING: THE ART OF BEING JUDGED BY A VOIDEvery error—every single one—was penalized. Repeatedly. If you made the same mistake across parts (a), (b), and (c), you didn’t lose points once—you lost points thrice. The TFs graded like they were charging interest. One missed negative sign? Minus 2. You do it again in the next part? Minus 2 again. By the end, you weren’t just wrong. You were in mathematical debt.One student asked during office hours if points could be recovered for consistency in error. The TF responded, “This isn’t a personality test.”You start to think maybe you’re being haunted by your earlier mistakes. You see the same comment show up four times. “Wrong bounds.” “Wrong bounds again.” “Still wrong bounds.” “Really?”At this point, it’s not grading. It’s punishment layered with sarcasm. Each red mark a scar. Each deduction a reminder that math is not merciful. It remembers. And it deducts accordingly.You turn in Midterm I with a trembling hand, praying for a shred of mercy. You checked your bounds. You showed your work. You even boxed your final answers like the TF said. But the paper comes back looking like it was marked by a sleep–deprived poet with a vendetta against optimism.“Your method is novel, though not correct.” — minus 6“This integral doesn’t converge. Much like your hope.” — minus 8“Your bounds are... interpretive?” — minus 4“This is not the unit circle’s fault.” — minus 5One student wrote “I used WolframAlpha” in pencil next to a graph. It got crossed out with, “So did I. Still wrong.”Midterm II was worse. Not just because of the math, but because you genuinely thought you were improving. You walked in with notes. You’d made your own convergence cheat sheet. You believed in yourself.The TF did not.“You seem to be confusing conditional convergence with emotional instability.” — minus 6“I am unsure what this sentence is trying to prove, mathematically or spiritually.” — minus 7“This looks like a Taylor series. It is not.” — minus 10“You forgot factorials. The factorials did not forget you.” — minus 12Someone else wrote a haiku instead of solving the 50–term expansion:Infinity loomsThe terms grow ever longerWhy are we still here?They received no points, but the TF underlined it and added: “This spoke to me.”Midterms weren’t assessments. They were confessions. And you were guilty.THE GRADING: A PSYCHOLOGICAL EXPERIMENT IN ABSURDITYWhen the final grades were released, you already knew it was over. But what you didn’t expect were the comments. The point deductions. The creative, soul–crushing notes left on your work like rejection letters from math itself.Here is a non–exhaustive list of actual phrases allegedly scrawled in red ink across student papers, accompanied by their corresponding point deductions:“This is not how cosine behaves.” — minus 5“You’ve summoned something dark here.” — minus 3“Technically not wrong, but also not right in any meaningful way.” — minus 7“Why is there a pirate metaphor in your radius of convergence explanation?” — minus 10“Are you okay?” — minus 2 (emotional concern but still penalized)“Octonauts ready for action.” — minus 40 (conduct penalty)“I’ve never seen someone integrate backwards before.” — minus 8“Creative, but cursed.” — minus 6“I’m giving partial credit out of pity.” — plus 2“No calculator does not mean write down vibes.” — minus 12One student included a small doodle of a slope field crying. It earned no points. Another wrote, “Please curve,” and it was underlined with a single word: “No.”You scroll through your exam. You see 58%, and next to it, a single note: “Good effort.” That’s it. Not “nice try.” Not “see me after class.” Just “good effort,” like you tried to bake cookies and burned down the kitchen.This isn’t grading. This is performance art.✦ . 　⁺ 　 . ✦ . 　⁺ 　 . ✦The 12–14 weeks of pain:WEEK 1: The Flirtation.You're doing substitution problems like it's a first date. Easy. Fun. You're smiling. You're posting your 10/10 PSET scores like they're thirst traps. You tell your friends, “I actually like this class.” You are innocent. You are foolish. You are doomed.WEEK 2: The Gaslight.The integrals start getting long. But not terrifying. Just enough to make you squint. Erica starts tossing out notation you haven’t seen before. A little mysterious. A little spicy. “Just remember your u–substitutions,” she says. You do. You try. You fail. But you think maybe it’s your fault. It always starts like this.WEEK 3: The Silent Treatment.You start asking questions in section. They don’t get answered. The TF writes something incomprehensible on the board and walks away. You're told “just review your notes.” But the notes are cryptic, half–written spells. You start to realize no one's coming to save you.WEEK 4: The Lovebomb and Withdrawal.You're handed a worksheet with 20 problems due the next day. You complete it. You get it right. You feel proud. You think maybe things are looking up. Then, next class, Erica pulls a full 180: infinite series. 10 new tests. No warning. No transition. Just pain.WEEK 5: The Gas Explosion.Ratio test. Root test. Alternating series. Absolute convergence. Conditional convergence. Everything converges—except your understanding. You try to memorize all the tests. They start blurring together. You make a chart. The chart lies to you.WEEK 6: The Breakdown.Your PSET takes 13 hours. You cry during office hours. You email your TF and get a reply that says “Try the Comparison Test.” You eat lunch while watching a Taylor Series video at 2x speed. You forget how food tastes.WEEK 7: The Taylor Spiral.You’re asked to write a Taylor polynomial about a point that doesn't even exist in the real world. You’re finding derivatives of transcendental functions using formulas you’ve never seen. “Just generalize,” says Erica. You generalize your sorrow.WEEK 8: The Identity Crisis.You start thinking maybe you were never good at math. Maybe you were never meant to be here. You think about switching majors. You think about dropping out. You wonder if Taylor series would converge faster than your GPA is falling.WEEK 9: The Philosophical Turn.You start agreeing with Nietzsche. God is dead, and Erica killed him with a radius of convergence. You find yourself contemplating existence in lecture. You raise your hand to ask, “What does it mean for a series to truly converge?” and the TF writes a summation sign and walks away.WEEK 10: The Hollowing.You are no longer a student. You are a vessel for confusion and half–finished differentials. Your dreams are narrated by series expansions. Your nightmares are slope fields. You sit in lecture and simply accept. Acceptance is the final stage of grief. Math 1B has won.WEEK 11: The Differential Descent.The word “differential” used to sound vaguely scientific. Maybe even elegant. Now, it triggers a full–body reaction. Erica walks in, picks up the chalk, and says “Let’s solve a second–order linear nonhomogeneous differential equation,” and you start to see colors that aren’t there.You thought integrals were bad. You thought convergence tests were painful. You had no idea. Now it’s y double prime plus y prime plus y equals e^x times a cosine. You’re supposed to use undetermined coefficients. Variation of parameters. The method of annihilators. You try to look it up, but Google says “Did you mean: you’re screwed?”WEEK 12: The Breakdown, Redux.The problem sets now involve three layers of differential logic. You’re solving for particular solutions, homogeneous solutions, general solutions—at this point, you just want a solution to your life. You stare at the DE on the board and think, “This must be what it feels like to go insane slowly, beautifully, with a pencil.”You try to ask a question, but it comes out as a sound. Just a noise. Erica responds with a formula that looks like a summoning spell. You copy it down because you’ve stopped resisting. Your notebook is no longer for learning. It’s a place to document the decline.WEEK 13: The Rage.You’ve stopped suffering in silence. You curse aloud during problem sets. You type “Why does Taylor do this” into Google. You threaten to drop a major just to spite this class. You write “Help me” in your notebook and underline it 30 times. Your TF makes eye contact and flinches. You get into a fight with a friend who says, “It’s not that bad.” You cut them off. You were never that close anyway.WEEK 14: The Surrender.The final approaches. You don’t study. You prepare spiritually. You walk into the lecture hall like a condemned soul. You look around and see your classmates in various stages of denial, numbness, and caffeine–induced hysteria. Someone sharpens a pencil like it’s a sword. You nod. This is the end. You whisper “Octonauts ready for action” not as a joke—but as a prayer.✦ . 　⁺ 　 . ✦ . 　⁺ 　 . ✦THE FINAL EXAM: A LIVE–ACTION BETRAYALThey told us no food, no water, no calculator. I brought a cough drop. I was sick—sick in the way only Math 1B can make a person sick. Coughing, shaking, cold sweating through an exam that was colder than the room. A proctor approached me like I’d brought contraband. I was almost kicked out. For a cough drop. For daring to attempt basic respiratory survival during this academic deathmatch.Had I been removed, I think I would've finally cracked. The breakdown was brewing. Missing one more thing—one more community dinner, one more org meeting, one more birthday, one more final—might’ve been the end. This course had already taken too much. Had they removed me for that Ricola, I would’ve started speaking in series notation and crying Taylor terms.The lecture hall was quiet. Too quiet. You could feel the tension in the air as students filtered in—not chatting, not joking, just solemnly setting down mechanical pencils like weapons before a duel. You weren’t here to succeed. You were here to survive.The moment the clock hit 9:00 AM, the final exam was passed out, and the room collectively exhaled their last hope. You flipped the first page. It was already over.A second–order linear nonhomogeneous differential equation stared back at you like a death sentence. You tried to remember your method of undetermined coefficients. Your brain gave you a flashback to crying in office hours instead.By page two, someone had put their head down and wasn’t moving. By page three, you heard quiet sobbing. Page four had a parametric curve question that looked like a Rorschach test. Someone stood up, walked out, and never returned.A student in the back threw up. Another cursed audibly. The proctor didn’t even blink. This was normal. This was expected. This was Math 1B.You reached the Taylor series expansion and just stared. It wanted a 40–term expansion centered at a point that might not exist. You wrote four terms and then—without hesitation—wrote “Octonauts ready for action” at the bottom. Because what else could you do? Pray? Cry? Beg for mercy from a function?The last problem asked you to analyze convergence in a series that looked like it had been cursed by a Victorian child. You wrote “I’m sorry” in the margin.And then, somehow, it was over.You stumbled out of the lecture hall into the blinding daylight. Someone was weeping on the steps. Another was making a TikTok about the experience. You stood there, hollowed out, stripped of ego and energy—and smiled.Because it was done.Because you survived.Because despite everything—despite the conduct penalty, the sleepless nights, the cursed slope fields—you finished Math 1B.And for the first time in months, you felt joy. Real, tangible joy. The joy of walking away from the wreckage with your sanity mostly intact. Of knowing that you would never again have to write a Taylor series. Of knowing that Erica Dinkins could no longer touch you.Octonauts. Ready for freedom.EPILOGUE: A LETTER TO FUTURE FIRST–YEARSIf you’re reading this, it means you’ve heard the whispers. The legends. The rumors about Math 1B. Maybe you’re a freshman—bright–eyed, determined, ready to take on Harvard’s STEM courses with the energy of a caffeinated golden retriever. Maybe someone told you it wasn’t that bad. Maybe you believed them.Don’t.Math 1B is not just a class. It is a gauntlet. A psychological operation. A semester–long fever dream of integrals, infinite series, and unspeakable differential horrors. It is a trial by fire in which you will be burned, branded, and broken—and if you’re lucky, you’ll crawl out the other side with a C+ and a ghost permanently whispering “Taylor approximation” in your ear.But you don’t have to do this. You have choices. If you can place into 21A—do it. If you can take 1A instead—bless yourself and do it. Do not let the advisors lie to you. Do not let the siren song of “everyone takes it” lull you into the abyss. If someone from the department says “it builds character,” understand they mean it in the same way a collapsed bridge builds swimming skills.And if you’ve already committed—brace yourself. Arm yourself. Find your people. Make a meme folder. Go to office hours, even if only to sob quietly into your notebook. Watch lectures on 2x speed and let the confusion wash over you like a wave. Drink water. Sleep when you can. Mourn what you lose, celebrate what you finish.You will forget the math. But you will never forget the madness.Sincerely,A survivor of the series.–ON TF Trainor & CourseHead DinkinsLet’s not pretend. Let’s not tiptoe. Let’s talk about what it actually feels like to be in Math 1B, sitting under those godforsaken fluorescent lights while Erica Dinkins—the Course Head, the CEO of Cold Disdain, the Grand Inquisitor of Convergence—waltzes into the room with the emotional warmth of a malfunctioning Roomba.From the moment she steps in, the temperature drops. I’m not kidding. It physically feels colder. She has that presence—icy, distant, surgical. She doesn’t walk, she glides, like some sort of cryptic math spirit summoned by the cries of struggling freshmen.And you? You, sitting there with your notebook open and a half–chewed pencil in your hand, think to yourself: “I have a question. A real question. A good–faith question.” And you raise your hand. Slowly. Nervously. Hoping this will be the day the room finally turns human.But she turns to you. And that look—God, that look—is something you feel in your bones. Like she’s already done a triple integral of your soul and found it lacking. She doesn’t ask you what your question is. She doesn’t encourage. She just says, with that edge in her voice, “We already covered that.”Or worse: she answers your question with another question—abstract, symbolic, disembodied—and you’re left even more confused, now deeply ashamed, and maybe even wondering if you imagined the whole lecture.There were moments—moments burned into memory—where she’d write a horrifying expression on the board and say “this should be clear” while half the room was blinking like hostages. I saw people sweating, physically sweating, while trying to follow her derivation of a power series expansion around a point she pulled from the underworld. She once solved an entire differential equation in what I can only describe as emotional Morse code—rapid, hostile chalk movements—and when someone asked her to explain step three, she turned and looked like they’d just spit on Euclid.It’s not that she didn’t teach. It’s that she didn’t teach us. She taught ghosts. She taught theoretical students who already took Math 21A in the womb. If you weren’t in the top 5% of math fluency, you didn’t exist to her. You were an inconvenience. A background hum. Static in the calculus frequency she operated on.I started doubting myself in that room. Started shrinking. Started losing my voice. You don’t realize it at first, but it chips away at you. A comment here. A sigh there. A refusal to acknowledge the question that was maybe your one shot at getting it. And by the time Week 8 rolled around, I wasn’t asking anymore. I wasn’t engaging. I was surviving.But then there was Charlotte.And if I talk about Erica with fire, I talk about Charlotte with full–hearted, tear–streaked reverence.Charlotte is the kind of TF you write novels about. The kind of academic mentor you remember forever. She didn’t just help me understand the material. She helped me remember that I wasn’t stupid. That I still had value as a learner. That even though I wasn’t writing 40–term Taylor series in my sleep like some math cyborg, I was still worthy of kindness. Of patience.She never made me feel small. She never looked at me with that Erica–brand scorn. She would pause—pause mid–sentence—to make sure you were following. And if you weren’t, she wouldn’t move on. She’d go back. She’d re–explain. She’d ask what step lost you and trace it out carefully, like she was untangling a knot she wanted to help you loosen.There were nights—real, painful nights—where I would come to her with PSETs that looked like they’d been through a shredder. And she didn’t flinch. She’d say, “Okay. Let’s figure this out.” And those four words? They saved me. She made math feel like something I could try again. Not conquer. Not master. Just try.Charlotte made it safe to fail. Erica made it shameful.And that’s the difference. That’s the core of it.One woman walked in each day with an arsenal of equations and an air of silent judgment. The other walked in with a whiteboard marker and a heart.I don’t know what would’ve happened without Charlotte. I genuinely don’t. Because by Week 10, I was losing it. I was losing myself. But she reminded me that Math 1B didn’t get to define me. That I was more than a percent, more than a boxed final answer with a red X. She reminded me that learning is a process, not a punishment.So yeah—Erica ran the show. But Charlotte? Charlotte saved it.And if no one else says it, I will: give that woman a raise. Give her tenure. Give her the course. Because she taught with grace in a system built to break us.And I’ll never forget that.",-0.9959,,0.0

If your experience in this class is anything like mine, you'll receive many perfect scores on psets from lazy CAs, and while this is a great problem to have, you'll be convinced that the work you do on psets is correct and therefore should be applied to the exams. Wrong... the TFs grade harshly, and you'll be forced to go back to every lesson on your own and correct your current logic.

Taking Math 21a allowed me to have a solid understanding of the content, and I appreciate the amount of effort put into teaching the material. It meets 3 times a week in small class sections, which is by far the best part of the course. Your TF will lecture, and you solve problems with others at your tables or on the chalkboards in small groups – repeating this with the next iteration of new content multiple times in each lecture. This makes it helpful to follow and understand the material. I think you only need AP Calculus AB (or Math 1a) and some self–studying of integration by parts to take this course. It is not hard as long as you take the time to understand the material before the next lecture. The most important piece of advice I have is to not fall behind!The midterm exams were very fair. I never left feeling like I had not studied enough. However, the PSETS and AI Assignments, which I believe were new this semester, were my least favorite part of the course. I am very detail–oriented and try to understand everything for an easier study period when exams come up. As a consequence for me, I spent 4–5 hours on average for most of the PSETS in this course. Some people I know were able to get them done faster. The AI assignments were problematic because the AI tutor simply refuses to tell you if you are on the right track with your answers.Overall, this course is great!",0.951,,0.0,,0.0

Midterm 2 for us was so bad. Most of me friends and I got horrible grades (aka < 60%) but it's consistently this trend of people who already know the material getting A's and us who studied for weeks (genuinely) and getting screwed over with the unrealistic expectations. I am writing this at a time where I haven't taken the final yet, but this class has been MISERABLE and it will be MISERABLE if you are like me, coming from a non–math extensive background and a high school with limited resources.

I think you are more than ready, but be prepared to wrestle with these concepts. Ultimately, I would recommend that you create a schedule to frequent office hours; this not only helps you with your pset grades, but also ensures that you ask questions to the teaching team that aid in your conceptual understanding of the material, as having agency over it will be valuable in courses that use linear algebra. In that schedule, I would also suggest reading the prescribed textbook sections before section and after, and reviewing the worksheet solutions. THEN work on the PSet during office hours. This will likely ensure a close to 100% uptake of the material with lasting and intuitive understanding. Review for incoming first–years: Depending on the high school you are coming from, this may be vastly different or similar to what you are used to, so give yourself some time to try out different study techniques, especially for this course, as the three psets a week can really grind your gears. If you have a decent understanding of multi, then you are more than ready for this course. It will refer to multi concepts a few times for specific lessons but some review should suffice.

It was the second most enjoyable after 21a and definitely built off of a bit of 21a, so I'd just recommend starting with 21a. The PSETs for this class are long and having three of them a week is annoying but it really does make you learn the content. Overall, like every intro math class, very solid but again highly dependent on your TF (I had Roderic and he was awesome!!), so don't be afraid of jumping around sections in the beginning to find the right TF for you. My only pet peeve with this class is the T or F, I understand that it allows you to cover more content in a very short format but I feel like there have got to be better ways of doing that than testing corner cases of theory. I don't think students will remember a specific counter example for something about the kernel in an nth dimension vs what a fourier series was and how it is applicable. I just think that isn't very conducive to learning, especially if it can come down to just a 50/50 chance and you not even having to explain your train of thought. Idk. I think if you get them right without knowing you got free points, but at the same time it's very difficult to study and be prepared for those corner cases. Also, perhaps changing the format of the weekly quiz sessions again so that maybe 4 quiz session attendances (so a month) is equal to one pset drop with a max of two extra pset drops or something because I feel like late hours for psets really isn't useful because there is already immediately another one breathing down your neck. The exams were relatively easier than the practices but you learn so much from the practices and they really humble you so you go in prepared for the exams. Overall, great course, content is super interesting but difficult, same old of doing the psets with a pset group, paying a lot of attention in class, and grinding a lot before exams by doing all the practice exams.",0.989,Honestly more interesting than 21a but I will say that the tests are slightly more difficult.

That being said, he made a significant number of improvements based on feedback. Here are a few; there are not longer random extra days of class, section is optional now, lectures feel better paced with a bit more time for problems, attendance sheets were simplified and make more sense, the random extra coding/math projects are gone, and so on. It is also clear from the syllabus that Prof. Wood read through the Q guide, identified resources that were particularly helpful to students last semester, and emphasized them this semester. Perhaps the only note I have about this course is that students should really take 22a first, as a lot of 22b draws on concepts from 22a (especially at the beginning of class).  It helps to brush up on 22a materials also, especially if you may have forgotten over winter break or took 22a longer than a semester ago. Other than that, this course is pretty straightforward – grading is to your benefit, classes are easy to follow, and the prof cares a lot and so makes the material interesting (therefore making it easier to learn). This course has 3 midterms (they weren't bad, were graded pretty leniently and the questions made sense). It is proof based, so much of the homework involves writing proofs instead of explicit calculation. Especially compared to 21, this class has only one pset and one brief online assignment per week, making it by and far less stressful (source; the pained looks on the faces of my friends in 21). Teaching staff are nice and available when needed. I felt that I took a lot away from this course, and I would definitely recommend it! (Bonus note; if you are free, the best office hours to go to are Wood's own – he explains stuff better (more effectively and more efficiently) and is super nice. I had classes during his OH this semester, but if you can, definitely go and say hi)",0.9981,"You'll come away from this class proficient in applying Stokes' Theorem, but without much understanding of why we're using said theorem or why we took a certain approach to prove it. You'll learn to perform the calculations, but not truly understand the structure governing multivariable calculus — which is concerning, considering that this is a proof–based course (for reference, I attended every lecture and kept up with the material; I still felt somewhat lost as to the ""why""; maybe also because there are almost zero real–world application problems to see theorems in action). There are also issues with organization. Problem sets have little to nothing to do with exam material, and often require leaps of thinking that necessitate going to office hours to find a very specific approach. Points are also taken off arbitrarily by CAs who were perhaps grading carelessly — but if you confront Dr. Wood about a possible grading mistake, he's extremely unlikely to change it (he'll just try to retroactively justify why the choice was made, even when it's clear that it was a mistake). Exam practice materials are posted extremely late and often come with no solutions and many errors.With that said, the course pack structure — in which Dr. Wood lectures and students follow along in a set of notes containing theorems and practice problems — works well, and the exams aren't unreasonable. A decent option for those looking for a somewhat more rigorous approach to multivariable calculus but aren't interested in spending 20 hours/week on Math 25 or 55.",-0.9663,,0.0

Switching to 55b was probably the absolute best decision I made this semester and I have absolutely zero regrets about doing so. Yes, the workload was pretty insane at points (prepare for a LOT of all nighters), but you will definitely get through it. You also won't need much content from 55a. There's a bit of algebra when it comes to algebraic topology, but it is completely learnable when you get to that point. There was an in person midterm which was pretty brutal, but it was a small percentage of the grade so it really didn't matter in the end. Most of your grade will be from psets, so if you invest a lot of time into those and find a good group of friends to work on them with, you will be absolutely fine.

The course content is so interesting and you really learn a lot, but that's in spite of the fact that the teaching staff is basically incompetent. Some of the TFs were amazing, but Brazelton was unorganized, unempathetic, and just seemed to really not care about his students' learning experience. The homework problems came out of left field and we were NOT equipped with the tools to solve problems, leaving us to go to OH to solve it. That would be fine if the OH weren't being cancelled every single week, or Brazelton answered his email within the day. Unfortunately, this class was horribly taught. I would recommend you take it only if it's taught by someone else. Shoutout Victor on the TF team because he is the goat and would hold extra review sessions and OH just to make sure we understood the material.",-0.9323,,0.0

The content itself is not sophisticated, but the lectures were very poorly given. They were really confusing, and hard to follow what even the professor was talking about. Many students learned the material from other sources themselves since the lectures were totally useless. In fact, the lectures made me forget the things I already knew. Grading on the problem sets was extremely slow. They really took their time to grade so you did not get frequent feedback on how you are doing. Also, the scoring was extremely inconsistent (across psets and students). Overall, I would NOT take this course unless you are 100% confident in the ability of the lecturer and the CAs.

If you engage with the readings and lecturers, you'll be able to come away with a lot of cool insights into the immunology research done in the Harvard community. There is just one major assignment which is a grant–style specific aims page due at the end of the semester. This can feel a bit unapproachable if you don't have any experience with writing grants. I would start early so you can start brainstorming ideas and reading papers. You'll need to do a lot more reading than you think to land on a topic – if you found a lecture particularly interesting that is a good place to start. Do not hesitate to reach out to the course director if you need more direction.",0.9049,,0.0,,0.0

There's a lot of new information to absorb each week, as the course is structured to have a different guest lecturer with a different expertise each week.  Also, you are expected to participate at least 2x a class (they count by ticking your name off next to your photo in the course roster), which is very hard to do if you are just learning things for the first time in the class. Weekly, you are expected to read two (usually dense/difficult) papers, and answer participation questions on them. One time during the semester, you are to present a paper to the class, a journal club of sorts. The semester paper is a research proposal focused in microbiology, but you have plenty of time to work on that and get plenty of feedback. Overall, I would recommend this course but would definitely suggest being mindful of how confident or willing you feel in wanting to learn so much on your own each week!",0.9008,,0.0,,0.0

You could almost call this course ""The Economy and Religion in the Middle Ages"" because you learn so much about how money and religion were intertwined. 3) It expanded by world view in a huge way...I am not religious at all, but many of my classmates were, and I think I grew a lot as a person and students listening and engaging with students who have very different approaches to the world than I do 4) You should expect to do 85%+ of the reading, but if you're someone who enjoys seminar courses, this is a great class for you.

Beyond that, he is also a very careful and talented historian, and he does a good job of breaking down his thinking process for the class, rather than just present his conclusions; I learned a lot from observing the way that he reached historical conclusions and from his critiques of historical theories that he thinks are incorrect or lack sufficient proof.  He also is very attentive to student interests: he builds every lecture around students' questions and devotes a truly unusual amount of time and care to giving feedback on papers. It's a manageable amount of work.That said, this class is not for everyone. Not everyone finds the minutiae of medieval legal rules interesting, and this class might be rather dry for such people, even if the big picture conclusions are interesting.

The second half of the course (where students present on landmark cases) is particularly fascinating. You gain a much deeper understanding of patients you may have only briefly encountered in introductory psychology courses.That said, the first portion of the course could benefit from a bit more structure and clarity. I understand it’s challenging to condense an entire neuroscience curriculum into just a few weeks, but it might help to focus primarily on the most essential concepts (such as brain areas and their functions) that are necessary for understanding the cases. Providing more visual materials (maybe through slides or supplemental readings) would also be helpful, especially since students come into this course with varying levels of background. Lastly, a short 5–10 minute break during the two–hour lectures would go a long way since maintaining focus through dense material can be quite tough.Overall, it’s an excellent, low–workload class led by a fantastic professor!",0.9844,,0.0,"Take this class for sure if you’re thinking about doing a MBB secondary (or concentration).

I hope the following information is helpful in guiding your decision, and once you make it, do not look back because the ""grass is always greener on the other side.""tldr: I was considering the switch to LS1b. I am glad I stayed in this course because of the community (I met some of my closest friends) and niche expertise of the professors (they are truly cool people and robust researchers). With that said, if you have a gut feeling that you should switch to LS1b, do it; we had one person switch due to different STEM interests and she was happy with her decision at the end of the semester. If LS50 had a toxic or competitive student environment, I would’ve undoubtedly done LS1b with Math 21a this semester.First, I will go into some of the positives about LS50. I believe this course has an amazing community that cannot be seen in many other classes except maybe Math 55. It’s a mix of trauma bonding at 3 am, learning about each other while psetting, going for late night Felipe’s/El Jefe’s runs together, etc. As people start to form smaller subgroups this semester, I’ve met incredible friends who I hope to stay close with for the rest of my life. You can also learn lots from your peers, as many LS50ers are RSI, Regeneron STS, SSP, and ISEF alums. The course assistants (CAs) and teaching fellows (TFs) are also remarkable; they genuinely care about you and your success, which is important for a class like Life Sciences 50.Academically, the professors are all very supportive and interesting people who have done cutting–edge research. LS50 will expose you to a diversity of scientific disciplines, which can help you decide on a future concentration. While a lot of ppl think they have a good idea coming in, by the end, many of my peers’ academic trajectories changed. Some switched from Neuro to Chem/Physical Bio; some dropped premed; some leaned more into HDRB. For the lab component, take advantage of this opportunity! Kevin was a joy to work with and compared to other courses, you spent most time actually *doing science* rather than spending hours on pre–labs and busy work. Note on the professors: Andrew is hilarious and is truly an inspiring scientist on yeast genetics. Emma is like an LS50 mom and was a gem to have. Cara is very clear and an amazing person to talk to about comp bio interests. Ben, while sometimes overloading lectures, is a cool person and great to know. Michael is also hilarious, and while his expectations are sometimes too high, he can explain things remarkably well.On the flip side, there are some IMPORTANT things to keep in mind. While it gets better after the first midterm, there’s still a very strong mathematical emphasis in the course. Overall, I liked the content of LS50b more but it’s a lie to say that it’s traditional bio/chem in the second half of the semester. I included a few notes below:– You WILL learn linear algebra in two weeks, but some of the hardcore material is honestly too much if you don’t have a *strong* mathematical foundation. It sometimes took a toll on both the physical and mental health of people I was close with in the class, including myself. No pset should cause people to pull multiple all–nighters or feel any negative thoughts; however, the tight–knit community allowed us to support each other during rough patches. This may be controversial among course staff but after talking with peers, lots of stat mech and dynamical systems could be replaced with more niche bio topics that set us up better for orgo (like Chem 20 – which you shouldn’t take with LS50b!), SCRB 10, etc.  Yes, we’re at Harvard; yes, this course is voluntary; yes, we’re supposed to be “the brightest future for science”; nonetheless, we are 18/19–year–olds figuring out our identities and the course expectations were too intense at times.– The rumor that every individual who takes this course gets an A and will get into PRISE/research village program is false. Out of the ~40 students, 15–17 will get an A; 15–17 will get an A–; and about 7–9 will end with a B+. I would assume it’s possible to get lower if you slack off significantly or cheat on exams. While participation in class is important (DON’T BE SCARED TO ASK QUESTIONS DURING LECTURE IF YOU TAKE LS50), your grade is basically dependent on the 3 midterms. You should get above the median on 2 out of 3 if you want an A, which is not always doable without serious dedication or being an inherently gifted mathematician/budding biologist with an innate understanding of chemistry. Practice problems are critical versus passive studying, though the quantity of practice problems were sometimes lacking.– I don’t necessarily regret taking LS50 and I know the course staff gets frustrated when students only think about grades, but it’s possible to be intellectually curious AND care about grades. LS50 may have prevented certain fellowships later on in college (lots of students get As broadly due to easier intro courses/grade inflation), and it’s unlikely that one can make the Phi Beta Kappa GPA cutoff with A–s or B+s (it counts for 2 classes each semester), even with straight As for subsequent semesters. There is no shame in taking LS1b. Since LS50 is mostly quantitative, it’s hard to say that I am less prepared for graduate school in biology/chemistry or even medicine in the future just because I struggled with topics like stat mech and Markov chains.– Students from amazing STEM magnet, international, or private schools have a clear advantage and it at times disadvantages those from under–funded or STEM–lacking high schools. I feel like there is a general correlation between getting an A in LS50 and doing Olympiads in HS, attending magnet schools that teach linalg/orgo, not being first–gen, etc. Though I want to avoid making generalizations, and if you devote sufficient time, anyone can succeed!– Some weeks feel quite disjointed and comparable to academic whiplash with topics alternating on different days. I don’t think it’s an issue per se, but it sometimes makes reviewing material challenging. I think this was expected going into the course. Also, I wish the course staff did more direct Python instruction or a spring workshop, since many of the PSET Colabs would take hours on end.Take everything with a grain of salt.

There is no shame in taking LS1b.

I feel like there is a general correlation between getting an A in LS50 and doing Olympiads in HS, attending magnet schools that teach linalg/orgo, not being first–gen, etc. Though I want to avoid making generalizations, and if you devote sufficient time, anyone can succeed!– Some weeks feel quite disjointed and comparable to academic whiplash with topics alternating on different days.

If LS50 had a toxic or competitive student environment, I would’ve undoubtedly done LS1b with Math 21a this semester.First, I will go into some of the positives about LS50. I believe this course has an amazing community that cannot be seen in many other classes except maybe Math 55. It’s a mix of trauma bonding at 3 am, learning about each other while psetting, going for late night Felipe’s/El Jefe’s runs together, etc. As people start to form smaller subgroups this semester, I’ve met incredible friends who I hope to stay close with for the rest of my life. You can also learn lots from your peers, as many LS50ers are RSI, Regeneron STS, SSP, and ISEF alums. The course assistants (CAs) and teaching fellows (TFs) are also remarkable; they genuinely care about you and your success, which is important for a class like Life Sciences 50.Academically, the professors are all very supportive and interesting people who have done cutting–edge research. LS50 will expose you to a diversity of scientific disciplines, which can help you decide on a future concentration. While a lot of ppl think they have a good idea coming in, by the end, many of my peers’ academic trajectories changed. Some switched from Neuro to Chem/Physical Bio; some dropped premed; some leaned more into HDRB. For the lab component, take advantage of this opportunity! Kevin was a joy to work with and compared to other courses, you spent most time actually *doing science* rather than spending hours on pre–labs and busy work. Note on the professors: Andrew is hilarious and is truly an inspiring scientist on yeast genetics. Emma is like an LS50 mom and was a gem to have. Cara is very clear and an amazing person to talk to about comp bio interests. Ben, while sometimes overloading lectures, is a cool person and great to know.

While it gets better after the first midterm, there’s still a very strong mathematical emphasis in the course.

It sometimes took a toll on both the physical and mental health of people I was close with in the class, including myself. No pset should cause people to pull multiple all–nighters or feel any negative thoughts; however, the tight–knit community allowed us to support each other during rough patches. This may be controversial among course staff but after talking with peers, lots of stat mech and dynamical systems could be replaced with more niche bio topics that set us up better for orgo (like Chem 20 – which you shouldn’t take with LS50b!), SCRB 10, etc.  Yes, we’re at Harvard; yes, this course is voluntary; yes, we’re supposed to be “the brightest future for science”; nonetheless, we are 18/19–year–olds figuring out our identities and the course expectations were too intense at times.– The rumor that every individual who takes this course gets an A and will get into PRISE/research village program is false. Out of the ~40 students, 15–17 will get an A; 15–17 will get an A–; and about 7–9 will end with a B+. I would assume it’s possible to get lower if you slack off significantly or cheat on exams. While participation in class is important (DON’T BE SCARED TO ASK QUESTIONS DURING LECTURE IF YOU TAKE LS50), your grade is basically dependent on the 3 midterms. You should get above the median on 2 out of 3 if you want an A, which is not always doable without serious dedication or being an inherently gifted mathematician/budding biologist with an innate understanding of chemistry. Practice problems are critical versus passive studying, though the quantity of practice problems were sometimes lacking.– I don’t necessarily regret taking LS50 and I know the course staff gets frustrated when students only think about grades, but it’s possible to be intellectually curious AND care about grades. LS50 may have prevented certain fellowships later on in college (lots of students get As broadly due to easier intro courses/grade inflation), and it’s unlikely that one can make the Phi Beta Kappa GPA cutoff with A–s or B+s (it counts for 2 classes each semester), even with straight As for subsequent semesters. There is no shame in taking LS1b. Since LS50 is mostly quantitative, it’s hard to say that I am less prepared for graduate school in biology/chemistry or even medicine in the future just because I struggled with topics like stat mech and Markov chains.– Students from amazing STEM magnet, international, or private schools have a clear advantage and it at times disadvantages those from under–funded or STEM–lacking high schools.

The structure of the class is very forgiving, with Problem Sets accounting for 75% of your overall grade while Participation counts for the other 25%. As a result, this means that there are no other assignments, exams, or projects within the course.The benefit of this structure is that MCB 125 is relatively easy to balance alongside your other classes, even if taken as a fifth course. There are only 6 Problem Sets throughout the semester, with them being spread out every other week. To be completely honest, most of us don’t even start the Problem Sets until the night before it’s due, meaning that we go through ~12 hours of misery in that moment before returning to a non–chalant, calm schedule again. However, if you would like help, the Office Hours for this class are the biggest highlight, with many of the TFs being extremely sweet and very accessible for questions.However, I think the biggest downside of this course relates back to the lecture component, which was often very unengaging. Although Professor Dulac is without a doubt extremely qualified to lecture on the content, her lectures are sometimes a little boring, which sometimes leads to students becoming very bored in class – occasionally even falling asleep. Combined with the fact that attendance is not accounted for within the course, this has resulted in student attendance dwindling as the semester progressed, with only 1/3 to 1/2 of the students attending lecture on a regular basis.The one warning I will provide future enrollees is that the grade cut–offs are not predetermined or announced to the class ahead of time. As of right now, the averages on PSETs have included the following: 96% (PSET 1), 95% (PSET 2), 96% (PSET 3), 97% (PSET 4), and unknown for PSET 5/6 since it is due during reading period. This means that all students have been doing very well in the course, which has made many of us anxious on how final letter grades will be determined. At this point in time, it is unclear if there will be an unreasonably high cutoff, which is still TBD. As a result, I would highly advise any prospective enrollees to check with former students in the coming semesters on a more accurate perspective on how finalized grading is determined. As a whole, given how MCB 125 comes with exams or projects outside of the six PSETs spread out across the semester, this makes it a relatively rewarding and relaxing class. Despite the lack of engagement, I think that MCB 125 remains a strong pick for anyone looking for a great class to balance alongside a busy semester.",0.9782,"Unless you are incredibly strong with biology, I don't really recommend this course. Professor Dulac has been one of my weakest lecturers and since everything can be very experiment/biology heavy, it can be difficult to follow at times. Having it be only a PSET class is very helpful though but they can be nit–picky with the grading at times.",-0.0568,Take it! the course load is pretty light if you manage your time well. definitely a hidden gem,0.807

Kudos to them for being very open minded about it and really wanting students to give their feedback. They adjusted PSET length mid–semester which was very fair and they were all overall very open to suggestions even within the course's syllabus. Overall, great teaching coming from Ryan, Hisham, and Jaime.Grading scheme: Loved that there were no exams, making the class very enjoyable and light. Especially if you want to explore something so nuanced and difficult like natural products, not having exams was great. The part about graded on effort I thought was a bit inconsistent with some of the grades I had friends getting given we did the PSETs together and put in the same effort. I think you have to be very clear if it is graded on effort or correctness and if its by effort, have very good feedback so that student understands they got the point for doing the question but have room to understand where they can grow. Also grading highly varied among CAs which is always difficult to understand and unfair, so finding a way to make that more standard is essential, especially if taking the effort–based route because then it just doesn't make sense if the same effort was placed on all PSETs that they wouldn't receive the similar grades.PSETs: The exposure to Pymol and Alphafold is super fun and those PSETs were very enjoyable, whereas the others just seemed very long and tedious. I feel like there are better ways of engaging with the course content than those 10 page PSETS. They did slowly change this up during the semester and condensed into more thought out questions which was great (perhaps just not the last PSET that had 20 pages and most people just dropped it especially because of final project presentations and other finals). I honestly think having more Pymol and Alphafold PSETs would've been a super enjoyable route and very rewarding too building those skills nowadays. Lectures: They leaned much more towards chemistry than bio which would make sense given it says pharmacy in the name of the course but I expected a perhaps more higher overview of the content on the chem side. A focus on understanding why certain plants are explored, their compound effect on the body, classes of plants to explore, etc was what I expected vs learning about terpenoids etc. I think these kinda do walk hand–in–hand so I'd just add that Chem27 is also a pre–req for the class because then the chem part isn't overwhelming and taking away from the experience, despite not having Chem27 hindering my experience completely.  Some of the first PSETs had questions more focused on the chemistry side that which is what we learned in Chem27 4 weeks later or something.Final Project: Super enjoyable putting into practice everything you learned in class and analyzing something of your choice. Highly recommend taking their early deadlines seriously and really planning out what you want to talk about vs last minute cramming because this is meant to be enjoyable and you understanding how your favorite natural product's mechanism and its 3D structure.",0.9983,"It's a really fun class that covers a lot of natural products and molecules!

(2) advocate for better systems – ask for a sign–up sheet for paper presentations, for papers to be uploaded at the same time weekly so you can plan ahead, for your reading grades, etc. they seem to expect the students to either have every deadline in their mind without reminders, which i suppose is a fair assumption, but it couldn't hurt to have some earlier nudges for a midterm proposal rather than on the day of.  the course staff are relatively accessible and supportive, but it definitely took a few requests for these changes to be implemented. would recommend for those with a strong interest in critical periods and those who enjoy/want to get better at reading scientific literature, but this course was definitely frustrating at first for students who value organized course structures and frequent communication about deadlines. as mentioned, i hope this improves because the course content was genuinely interesting, and all my frustrations were purely logistical. but in the event that these problems persist, as long as you keep an eye on that syllabus (literally pin it on your wall or something) you should be fine.",0.9967,,0.0,,0.0

You'll learn quite a bit about cancer mechanisms, factors or events that accelerate/promote tumorigenesis, immunotherapy, personalized therapy, cancer monitoring and tracking, cutting edge technology, etc through these papers. Assignments mainly involve creating scientific summaries and questions for assigned papers and preparing for journal clubs, discussions, and presentations.

The weekly workload is just reading a (relatively more complex) research paper and writing a 500–word summary for it. Sometimes it is a bit tricky deciding what to fit into your summary, but it is excellent practice for being concise and getting the broad picture when discussing a complex topic. There are not too many instructions for these assignments, so you have a lot of freedom in terms of how you approach your work. This could be helpful but it can also be confusing exactly what is expected of you. But I would say they are super chill graders, so if you put in decent effort and show you are doing your best to understand and grow, you'll be fine. Besides, you can always reach out with questions and they are usually very fast at answering emails. The quizzes during every class can sound daunting but usually they turn out fine. Just study your materials a bit before class and it shouldn't be a problem. The final presentation at the end of the semester, like all other assignments, were pretty flexible and you are not given that many instructions. So overall, I would just say give all assignments your best effort–––participate in section–––and you will do more than fine. The lack of directions sometimes can feel overwhelming at first, but I think that is supposed to help you and not hurt (or restrict) you too much.  Lastly, the lectures can be very fast–paced and confusing sometimes. The slides could have been more clear and informative for someone who does not know that much about viruses and HIV (the main virus we talk about throughout the semester). A lot of the times, I had to do more research after class to clear up what was discussed during class, but overall, no big problems.",0.9959,,0.0,,0.0

That being said, I really enjoyed the discussion aspect of the course and learning more from my peers about the papers they presented. The studies were really fascinating. I also gained a lot of critical thinking skills and research design/methodology skills (which isn't necessarily a huge emphasis of the course) through reading the papers and critically analyzing them.

Nancy is one of the most knowledgeable people within the field and is very evidently passionate about the field, making for interesting lectures.At times, Nancy can come off as very short due to her direct way of giving feedback (including interrupting students in the middle of presentations) but you will learn over time that she does not mean this in a bad way. Instead, she is merely old fashioned, and wants to see her students do the best they possibly can. Although this may come as a shock at first, you will soon learn that she is actually one of the biggest advocates for her students and an empathetic person, even if this does not immediately shine through.For grades, Nancy is very kind, often telling students to just try their best and to not worry about the end grade. Within the course, participation accounts for 50% of your grade, while the other 50% comes from an end–of–semester research project where you must propose an experiment to answer an interesting question in the field of chromosomes, completed through a 3 page research proposal and 10 minute presentation. Throughout the process, Nancy is very supportive and offers a lot of assistance to students that need it. Although her feedback will be very direct, it is also extremely well intentioned and helps a lot in refining ideas.As a whole, if you are able to take feedback well, MCB 188 is a good course and a relatively easy one in terms of the workload. If you genuinely put in effort into your end–of–semester project and your presentations throughout the semester, you will undoubtedly succeed.",0.9943,,0.0,,0.0

Taking Music 107 really adds another layer of engagement and understanding to the HRO experience, and getting the letter graded credit means you can prioritize it as a class (I took 3 classes one semester and used Music 107 as my fourth class) and really give it the time it deserves instead of relegating it to the bottom of the priority pile alongside other extracurriculars. As someone who hasn't taken other music classes, the readings can be hard to understand at times, and make me aware of my lack of background knowledge, but keeping with it and wading through it really leads to me learning a lot.

The one thing I will say is: do not underestimate the amount of time you have to put into the class. Of course, it is possible to breeze through by barely rehearsing, since the only mandatory thing is a 1 hour weekly coaching (and if your group wants to do this class this way that's totally valid). But after taking this class 4 times, I have realized most groups do actually want to sound good by the final concert, and are pretty serious about rehearsing. For my group, we had regular weekly rehearsals but also extra rehearsals for the performance classes, the final jury, and the final concert, and all that rehearsal time builds up—our group also had extra coaching sessions (so more time again). So ultimately whether this class is a 5th class gem or a pretty substantial class in itself really depends on how serious your group is about sounding good and rehearsing a lot (and note how much your group cares could change DURING the semester). As for the new policy removing pre–formed groups (starting Fall 2025), I understand it may be unpopular—but I agree with the decision. (For context, the status quo is that if you have a pre–formed group, you essentially get into the course automatically, without much consideration to the individual level of the players, and people who applied individually despite essentially being professional–level musicians have gotten rejected due to pre–formed groups having priority). I don't think this is fair, especially for students with professional–level training/performing experience. I think the audition process should be merit–based and not based on social connections and ultimately, whoever is a better musician gets to take the course. Moreover, yes, it is nice to play with your friends, but I think the purpose of a class like this should be personal and musical development. I think playing with people you don’t know—especially ones at a similar level—can actually be a better means to achieve this goal and can challenge you in different and productive ways. Of course, it works when a pre–formed group is compatible, but I believe that the overall pre–forming process often results in several unbalanced groups with players of different levels, resulting in a worse 189 experience for people in these unbalanced groups. I've also seen a fair amount of politicking with the pre–forming process e.g. people trying to “lock in” players early, or abandoning one group for a better one mid–process, which can get messy. I think the staff have a good idea of which players are similar in ability and compatible with others and will ultimately create more balanced groups, resulting in a better overall 189 experience for everyone. The counter of course is that this assumes the staff know better than the students which musicians will be more compatible with each other, which might be difficult in a 10–minute audition. BUT, at least they get to hear everyone directly and assess musical levels side–by–side and for me, that puts them in a better position than students to create balanced, compatible ensembles. Also, stepping back a bit, I don't think the policy is unreasonable—at chamber music festivals the norm is for the organizers/coaches to assign the groups, and in the industry groups are often pieced together last–minute and musicians often have no say in who they play with.Aside from this digression, this is a brilliant course that any classical musician at Harvard should consider taking!

I feel like we were able to contribute significant analysis with our final project while utilizing a lot of the concepts that we learned throughout the semester. The PSETs and assignments were difficult at–times but I felt that this difficulty was necessary for adequate retention of knowledge. Also, I'd say Dr. Penekis is a great lecturer and is really geared towards students (unlike other busy professors).

The structure of the class is very forgiving, with Problem Sets accounting for 75% of your overall grade while Participation counts for the other 25%. As a result, this means that there are no other assignments, exams, or projects within the course.The benefit of this structure is that MCB 125 is relatively easy to balance alongside your other classes, even if taken as a fifth course. There are only 6 Problem Sets throughout the semester, with them being spread out every other week. To be completely honest, most of us don’t even start the Problem Sets until the night before it’s due, meaning that we go through ~12 hours of misery in that moment before returning to a non–chalant, calm schedule again. However, if you would like help, the Office Hours for this class are the biggest highlight, with many of the TFs being extremely sweet and very accessible for questions.However, I think the biggest downside of this course relates back to the lecture component, which was often very unengaging. Although Professor Dulac is without a doubt extremely qualified to lecture on the content, her lectures are sometimes a little boring, which sometimes leads to students becoming very bored in class – occasionally even falling asleep. Combined with the fact that attendance is not accounted for within the course, this has resulted in student attendance dwindling as the semester progressed, with only 1/3 to 1/2 of the students attending lecture on a regular basis.The one warning I will provide future enrollees is that the grade cut–offs are not predetermined or announced to the class ahead of time. As of right now, the averages on PSETs have included the following: 96% (PSET 1), 95% (PSET 2), 96% (PSET 3), 97% (PSET 4), and unknown for PSET 5/6 since it is due during reading period. This means that all students have been doing very well in the course, which has made many of us anxious on how final letter grades will be determined. At this point in time, it is unclear if there will be an unreasonably high cutoff, which is still TBD. As a result, I would highly advise any prospective enrollees to check with former students in the coming semesters on a more accurate perspective on how finalized grading is determined. As a whole, given how MCB 125 comes with exams or projects outside of the six PSETs spread out across the semester, this makes it a relatively rewarding and relaxing class. Despite the lack of engagement, I think that MCB 125 remains a strong pick for anyone looking for a great class to balance alongside a busy semester.",0.9782,"Unless you are incredibly strong with biology, I don't really recommend this course. Professor Dulac has been one of my weakest lecturers and since everything can be very experiment/biology heavy, it can be difficult to follow at times. Having it be only a PSET class is very helpful though but they can be nit–picky with the grading at times.",-0.0568,Take it! the course load is pretty light if you manage your time well. definitely a hidden gem,0.807

(2) advocate for better systems – ask for a sign–up sheet for paper presentations, for papers to be uploaded at the same time weekly so you can plan ahead, for your reading grades, etc. they seem to expect the students to either have every deadline in their mind without reminders, which i suppose is a fair assumption, but it couldn't hurt to have some earlier nudges for a midterm proposal rather than on the day of.  the course staff are relatively accessible and supportive, but it definitely took a few requests for these changes to be implemented. would recommend for those with a strong interest in critical periods and those who enjoy/want to get better at reading scientific literature, but this course was definitely frustrating at first for students who value organized course structures and frequent communication about deadlines. as mentioned, i hope this improves because the course content was genuinely interesting, and all my frustrations were purely logistical. but in the event that these problems persist, as long as you keep an eye on that syllabus (literally pin it on your wall or something) you should be fine.",0.9967,,0.0,,0.0

It has seriously set my standards for every other class. My think is substantially clearer. (I will be changing my concentration as a result) I am not exaggerating: if you want to *learn* here, take this class.The reason is two–fold: the nature of the topic and the class itself. THE TOPICWe have NOT solved what these early modern writers were discussing. We have, in fact, made little progress. We've tried to ignore metaphysical questions as if they cease becoming relevant. But ignoring something does not make it go away, and serious problems with current scientific research and the general ""misinformation"" and extreme political polarization can be traced back to this.  It's insane and fascinating.The writers in this class invite you into the conversation. The works of the early modern period are IDEAL for beginners because a) you'll need to know something about Aristotle for any of them be intelligible  (+1 classic!) b) much of what they started continues today (+1 modern!). It's a 3 for 1 deal. You WILL see the same ideas discussed now, even if using different language (it's about the *substance* not the *word* people!). Things will make more sense, you will be able to *formulate your own thoughts* on them and assess where we simply do not know the answer.  (what is a scientific ""law""?)THE CLASS1) Teaching approach. Hands down.  – Working through the arguments of the text. This is so important. We learn the PROCESS the writers used and NOT ""Oh Descartes though this"".  When you go through the actual steps, the conclusion stop appearing mystical or like the result of revelations—though they still remain impressive. Finally: the historical context and the ""raw materials"" they were working with makes it click into place. I can confidently reconstruct most of the arguments we tackled now (which will make me very fun at parties).– Questions in class: Prof Simmons would ASK THE STUDENTS TO CLARIFY THEIR QUESTIONS so she answer it meaningfully and have students engaged in a conversation (wild!).  We use clear terms (insane!) She was also able to judge when a question would steer us off the main topic too much. – Relevant section topics. People were not just talking past each other (a miracle!).– Format Prof. Simmons using chalk is the right move. We are actually thinking through ideas instead of going through a prepared presentation. – I guarantee every other response raves about Prof. Simmons, so—yes, what they said. 2) Workload– Short assignments: these were the perfect balance of challenging and doable. The key part is that they had PURPOSE. The canvas page clearly states what skill each assignment targeted, and it was clear to judge where you fell short and see improvement throughout the semester. Many of my friends complain about busywork or vague assignments where they feel lost, this class is free of that. –  The questions for the final are released beforehand so you can prepare them together. Great discussions – The amount of reading is very manageable. There mix of required (og works) vs optional reading (secondary sources)! You do have to actually read the original works (if you don't want this bit, do not take the class. Full stop.)3) THE OTHER STUDENTS <This class attracts curious interesting  smart people who actually want to be there. I have formed the most actual friendships out of this class than any other, to the point where altered the trajectory of my social life here. We don't have shallow conversations and respect each other's ideas. It's great.",0.9978,"This is a fun class if you have some experience in philosophy and if you do all the readings. If you skimp on the readings, the lectures will be pretty much unintelligible, but the readings themselves can be kind of difficult and time–consuming. Grades can be a little discouraging but you do learn a lot and it's a solid introduction to metaphysics.",-0.4497,,0.0

If you're only kind of interested like I was/am, you'll have a good time, but things can get a little boring. The class is VERY formulaic week to week: you read a few texts, Seth explains them in lecture, and you discuss them in section. There is very little throughout the semester to break up this routine, which can make the whole course just blend into one big blob of philosophy. That being said, I still give this class a very positive review. Seth is very intentional with what/how he teaches, and it's obvious that one of his goals is for each of his students to leave his class as better people. He's also just a cool dude, and makes the whole class a super chill vibe. I also really like how major assignments are structured. You have to write two ~1500 word essays which are based more on your own thinking and perspective than a standard research paper.

I can not tell you exactly what you will learn, since the course is improved upon each semester, but I can tell you that it will be fundamentally fascinating. We spent the first half of the semester essentially rederiving linear algebra, and the second rederiving all of the axioms of quantum mechanics, all from base principles with very little prior math knowledge needed. Readings included many paper from the original proposal/formulations of quantum mechanics, and section/OH helped a lot with interpretation, so that prior philosophy knowledge requirements were also minimal. Though I took the course as Phil 151, there was a fairly even distribution of people who took it as a physics course, and one could consistently rely on others who had more experience in either physics or philosophy for perspective. The class is small (30ish people), competitive to get into (because the subject and professor are both well liked by students), and takes all years/levels of experience (everything is self contained/taught within the course). This is also a wonderful class for a more logical/formulaic philosophy experience and a more questions/interpretation–based experience physics. I would definitely recommend attending section/OH if possible, the material is fascinating and teaching staff are very willing to discuss related topics. The course generally follows the professors own formulation of quantum mechanics, has no exams (only a final essay), and has only one pset a week (with a reading section and a very straightforward math section).

MATHERNE. She is a genius, incredible lecturer, and conversations with her in office hours are invaluable.  I don't even study philosophy, but I wish I did after taking her class. Do not make the mistake I did and wait until your senior year to take a course with her. Take one as early as possible. And then another. And then another. For practical information about this course: One of the reasons why this class was so great, was that everyone was so bought in that class participation was actually very productive, which allowed the 40–person class to feel like a community by March. This class is not a gem. I spent a good amount of my time reading every week, because you are practically reading one Austen book every 2 weeks, on top of philosophy readings. If you are going to take this class, know that you will have to commit to doing all of the readings in order to get the full experience of this course. This is not to scare anyone off – Prof. Matherne is so accessible with explaining philosophy and making it comfortable for anyone, no matter their experience, to participate in class – HOWEVER I would recommend that you do not take this class as a buffer/light workload class during a heavy semester, but as a class you expect to devote about 5–10 hours of intentional reading to each week. The more you have the time to  engage with this course – doing all of the readings, supplemental readings, going to office hours, thinking about it in your free time – the more you will get out of it. You also shouldn't worry about papers. They are very clearly structured for you (similar to other Matherne papers, if you've taken a course before) so that you know exactly what is expected to do well. There are also multiple interesting prompt options, so if you want to avoid writing about the complicated mess of Mansfield Park, you can do that. Final thoughts: This class is for people who wonder, ""What makes philosophy, philosophy?"" This isn't a phil course where a philosopher's work is reconstructed neatly by the professor, but one where the concept of philosophy is called into question. The project of understanding Austen as a philosopher is very alive and in process, so you may find yourself strongly disagreeing with a lecture from Prof. Matherne, or questioning if Austen is really a philosopher at all.

I took this class coming off of AP Physics 1, and honestly, I wasn’t sure what to expect. I’d learned the basics, but I was looking for something that would push me further without turning into an all–consuming nightmare. Physical Sciences 12a totally delivered on that. It’s not just a repeat of high school physics—it’s a chance to build on what you already know, dive deeper into some cool stuff like fluid mechanics, and leave with a stronger understanding of physics than you walked in with.It’s also just a great course if you want to understand physics but not dive into the deep end. For someone like me, who’s not majoring in physics but needs a solid foundation for engineering, this class was perfectPros:A Real Review That’s Actually Helpful:Coming from AP Physics 1, I thought I knew the basics. Like, I knew how to do some basic mechanics, forces, and energy problems. But when I jumped into 12a, I realized that there’s a level of depth I hadn’t even touched yet. This course didn’t just breeze through what I already knew—it helped me really understand it. Fluid mechanics was a whole new world for me, and I got to see how the math and concepts actually fit together. Honestly, I walked out of this class with a much better grasp of physics than I had going in.Demos & Labs: Total Game Changer:Let’s be real, I didn’t expect the demos to be as entertaining as they were. They were straight–up cool. We didn’t just watch some pendulum swing back and forth—these demos brought the physics to life in ways that made everything feel real. And the labs? They weren’t just a way to pass time. I actually enjoyed them. I got to team up with people, test out theories, and see how physics works in the real world. It wasn’t some dry, boring “let’s just get this done” experience—it was genuinely fun. Plus, the labs were a good way to meet people, so there’s that bonus.Stars System: Not Perfect, But Solid:I was a little skeptical about the Stars system at first, but once I got into it, I saw how it helped me stay on top of the material. The idea is simple: prove you know your stuff, earn a Star. It gives you smaller, more manageable goals to work toward instead of one big exam stress fest. Now, I’m not gonna lie, the Stars system can be intense. If you mess up even a little bit, you miss the Star. But there’s a silver lining: if you miss a Star, you can meet with the course leadership to show that you’ve got a handle on the material. It’s kind of like an insurance policy—you get another shot to prove you know your stuff. This kept me from panicking about exams and helped me focus on actually learning.Incredible Support from the Course Leadership:One of my favorite things about this class was the course leadership. They weren’t just checking boxes—they actually cared that you understood the material. Any time I had a question or felt like I was falling behind, they were there to help. It wasn’t some generic “go to office hours” vibe; they’d actually meet with you one–on–one, break down concepts until they clicked, and make sure you were on the right track. It was refreshing, especially in a course that’s got some heavy material.Confidence Boost Like No Other:Before this course, I felt like I understood physics, but not in the deep way I wanted to. After 12a, though? I felt like I could actually do physics. The new material, like fluid mechanics, was challenging, but the course gave me the tools and understanding to tackle it head–on. By the end of it, I was ready to keep going with physics. If you’ve taken AP Physics 1 or have some basic understanding and are worried about taking that next step, this course will give you the confidence you need to keep pushing forward.Shoutout to the CAs:Alright, let’s talk about problem sets. They’re no joke. But what made them manageable was the support I got from the CAs. Seriously—if you’re struggling, get to office hours. The CAs (NeNe, Rohil, Will, Tyler—you guys are the real MVPs) were always ready to break things down and explain stuff until it clicked. It made those PSets way less stressful, and honestly, I probably wouldn’t have made it through without their help.Cons:9 A.M. = No Fun:We all know how it goes—9 a.m. is way too early for anything. Especially when you’ve been pulling late–night study sessions, dealing with other classes, or just living your life. Getting up for this class felt like an Olympic sport in itself. Don’t let the early start fool you—if you’re not a morning person, prepare to drag yourself out of bed.Stars System (Again):As much as I loved the Stars system, it’s not all sunshine and rainbows. There were times where I felt like the smallest mistake—something minor—would cost me a Star. And that little bit of stress over missing Stars can get to you, especially if you're someone who’s a little on the perfectionist side. It’s a great system in theory, but it can sometimes feel like you're walking a tightrope.Coding Projects (Sigh):Okay, I get it—coding is part of the physics game now, and I see the value of integrating it. But honestly? The coding projects were a bit of a headache. It wasn’t a huge deal since they’re not on the final, but they still felt like extra busywork. They weren’t terrible, just kind of annoying.PSets Are Time–Consuming (But What Else Is New?):Let’s face it—problem sets in any physics class are going to take time. These were no exception. Some weeks, I’d be buried in them for hours. It’s manageable, but if you’ve got a packed schedule, they can start to feel like a never–ending cycle.

It was refreshing, especially in a course that’s got some heavy material.Confidence Boost Like No Other:Before this course, I felt like I understood physics, but not in the deep way I wanted to. After 12a, though? I felt like I could actually do physics. The new material, like fluid mechanics, was challenging, but the course gave me the tools and understanding to tackle it head–on. By the end of it, I was ready to keep going with physics. If you’ve taken AP Physics 1 or have some basic understanding and are worried about taking that next step, this course will give you the confidence you need to keep pushing forward.Shoutout to the CAs:Alright, let’s talk about problem sets. They’re no joke. But what made them manageable was the support I got from the CAs. Seriously—if you’re struggling, get to office hours. The CAs (NeNe, Rohil, Will, Tyler—you guys are the real MVPs) were always ready to break things down and explain stuff until it clicked. It made those PSets way less stressful, and honestly, I probably wouldn’t have made it through without their help.Cons:9 A.M. = No Fun:We all know how it goes—9 a.m. is way too early for anything. Especially when you’ve been pulling late–night study sessions, dealing with other classes, or just living your life. Getting up for this class felt like an Olympic sport in itself. Don’t let the early start fool you—if you’re not a morning person, prepare to drag yourself out of bed.Stars System (Again):As much as I loved the Stars system, it’s not all sunshine and rainbows. There were times where I felt like the smallest mistake—something minor—would cost me a Star. And that little bit of stress over missing Stars can get to you, especially if you're someone who’s a little on the perfectionist side. It’s a great system in theory, but it can sometimes feel like you're walking a tightrope.Coding Projects (Sigh):Okay, I get it—coding is part of the physics game now, and I see the value of integrating it. But honestly? The coding projects were a bit of a headache. It wasn’t a huge deal since they’re not on the final, but they still felt like extra busywork. They weren’t terrible, just kind of annoying.PSets Are Time–Consuming (But What Else Is New?):Let’s face it—problem sets in any physics class are going to take time. These were no exception. Some weeks, I’d be buried in them for hours. It’s manageable, but if you’ve got a packed schedule, they can start to feel like a never–ending cycle. Again, office hours help, but they do take up a good chunk of your time.",0.9987,"This course teaches more than other introductory physics courses, but the format of the course is terrible.

If you want an answer to the question ""what were your top 5 most favorite classes you took throughout all college?"" this should be top 3, if not the first.  This class is MIT's equivalent of ""how to build almost everything"", and you're not missing out by not taking the MIT version: this is seriously one of the best courses offered here.My background: CS/Econ.  Almost no 'building–hardware' experience but wanted to explore that.You get to work with a small group of people, which I think really adds to the vibe.  The staff and teaching fellows are super fun to hang around and are very easy to ask questions to.  What's kind of funny is that the lab is in the science center (SC 102) and visitors will come by to look in at the work you're doing.  Feels like you're on display, which some may not like, but I actually loved it because it felt cool to show off what you've been working on![What I Learned]The course site essentially describes all of this, but I'll put it here:– Microcontroller programming– CNC Milling (wood, acrylic, foam)– Laser Cutting (wood, acrylic)– Metalwork– Circuitry fundamentals (capacitors, resistors, breadboards)– Inputs/outputs you can attach to the circuit (servos and other actuators, stepper/DC motors, Piezo buzzers, RFID scanners, light displays, and so much more)– Circuit board fabrication (PCBs)– Radio communication (wired, wireless, Bluetooth)[Typical Week]– You'll be given a project to work on Tuesday, then have until the following Thursday to complete it.– If you don't complete it to the level you desire, you're free to redo it or continue on it until the end of the semester, but I advise just moving on and focusing on the next weekly task, then go back to that one at the end, that way you're not feeling lagged behind by any means.– The workload each week is not the same.  Some projects will take longer.  Of all the weeks, I think the heaviest weeks are: kinetic sculpture, radio communication, and machine building (robot machine).  Those weeks take about 10 hours.Again, PLEASE TAKE THIS COURSE IF YOU WANNA DO HANDS ON WORK.  This stuff is so fun.  I know I say 10 hours for the worst weeks but honestly it does not even feel like 10 weeks, it's more like ""an hour of work here"" and ""two hours of work there"", what's nice is you can basically come in any time with a buddy and they have so many office hours it's quite ridiculous, there's never a shortage of that.

I took 21b concurrently, which is totally doable since most of the necessary math is taught during lecture or can be learned as you do the PSETs.  You also don't need to have taken 15b, although the EM–wave content near the end of the course will probably be easier if you have. Overall, PSETs and exams were very fair and not too painful. Content–wise, the first half was a little dry, but not as hard, while the second half was much more interesting in my opinion but conceptually required more effort. Definitely go to office hours if you have any questions at all about the PSETs, which you probably will because the PSETs did not always align or seem entirely relevant to what we were learning in class, but they were still figure–out–able with office hours and not too long, which was nice. My biggest (and one of my only) complaints about this class is that section could be massively improved. I think it would be better if students were guided through the section problems during section, or, at the very least if they could check their solutions to the section problems against a detailed answer key to make sure they leave section with an understanding of how to do all of the problems. I often left section feeling much more confused than when I arrived because I would leave with a whole list of problems I had no idea how to solve, and solutions would not be posted until over a week after the section.

It's my favorite course I've ever had at Harvard. If you're trying to decide, this is your sign. TAKE IT. But on a more serious note, if you're wondering what this course is like, it really is a physicist's math course. It's all about giving you the tools to solve problems. In a typical math course, we learn techniques and kind of problems, but there's a lot of theory and explanation surrounding it. It's not that the course fails to give you a solid theoretical grounding, but it's less concerned with rigor, giving you enough of an intro to understand the motivation behind a formula without exhaustive justification of our methods. But because of this, you can cover SO MUCH. For example, I took Math 113 and learned wonderful things, but in terms of how to solve actual problems in the field, a week of this course taught me 80% of a semester of Math 113. And the math is SO relevant for a physicist. I was taking 143A at the same time and often I'd learn a subject in 106 then have to apply it or derive it in 143A a week later. And the course is really fun. interesting lectures cool problems. In summary the course A. Will teach you a lot. B. Is super relevant to physics. C. Is really fun.

I can not tell you exactly what you will learn, since the course is improved upon each semester, but I can tell you that it will be fundamentally fascinating. We spent the first half of the semester essentially rederiving linear algebra, and the second rederiving all of the axioms of quantum mechanics, all from base principles with very little prior math knowledge needed. Readings included many paper from the original proposal/formulations of quantum mechanics, and section/OH helped a lot with interpretation, so that prior philosophy knowledge requirements were also minimal. Though I took the course as Phil 151, there was a fairly even distribution of people who took it as a physics course, and one could consistently rely on others who had more experience in either physics or philosophy for perspective. The class is small (30ish people), competitive to get into (because the subject and professor are both well liked by students), and takes all years/levels of experience (everything is self contained/taught within the course). This is also a wonderful class for a more logical/formulaic philosophy experience and a more questions/interpretation–based experience physics. I would definitely recommend attending section/OH if possible, the material is fascinating and teaching staff are very willing to discuss related topics. The course generally follows the professors own formulation of quantum mechanics, has no exams (only a final essay), and has only one pset a week (with a reading section and a very straightforward math section). Overall, I had a wonderful time in this class and would absolutely choose to take it again.

Although Girma is not the clearest of lecturers, this is compensated by his boundless enthusiasm and love for electrodynamics which he radiates (no EM pun intended) at every lecture! Girma is a very accessible instructor whom you can ask any question without fear of judgment, and it was always a pleasure to attend his office hours during which I gained a lot of physical insight. The subject–matter of the course — electrodynamics — is an extremely beautiful subject, and knowledge and mastery thereof is crucial to any budding theoretical physicist. Unfortunately, we did not cover the entirety of Griffiths in sufficient depth due to temporal constraints — which is a shame — but in future renditions of the course, this can be easily remedied by adding a third lecture every week. In terms of prior background and preparation, 153 is a self–contained course that builds up the theory of classical electrodynamics from scratch, so you really do not need a ton of prior knowledge in EM (contrary to what the course prerequisites might say). That being said, such knowledge is useful insofar as it makes the fast pace of 153 more manageable. Personally, I came into the class with only AP Physics C and physics 19 under my belt and did just fine (incidentally, this just goes to show that physics 16 really is unnecessary for more advanced courses like 153). If you're considering taking 153, my suggestion would be to study chapter 1 of Griffiths over winter break if you have never seen multi–variable calculus before. If you have time, you should also take a look at chapters 2 and 3 just so that you don't get lost in the first few weeks. To end this QGuide, I'd like to give some advice on how to get the most out of 153 during the semester. Besides going to all the lectures, I strongly recommend that you read Griffiths (by read, I mean read it religiously). Due to lack of time, I did not read Griffiths in its entirety, which in hindsight I regret given the phenomenal amount of physical insight that this book contains. I think the best strategy is to read Girma's lecture notes before coming to lecture to get a brief overview of the material that will be covered (otherwise, you will easily get lost, because oftentimes Girma skips a lot of the mathematical steps and refers you to the lecture notes), and then after lecture you can read the corresponding sections/chapters in Griffiths to solidify your understanding. I cannot stress the importance of doing this, because with the take–home format of the exams, it is very easy to get away with fragmented understanding of the material, whereas what you should be aiming for is a robust grasp on electrodynamics. TL;DR: Fantastic course, beautiful material, wonderful instructor. Not a lot of background is required. Just read the first chapter(s) of Griffiths over winter break, and make an effort to read the textbook throughout the semester to get the most out of this course.",0.9966,"I would describe this course as a mathematical methods course for physics.

First of all, the teaching staff: Professor Schwartz is deeply passionate about the material and teaching as such. He truly wants you to understand statistical mechanics and how to apply it to whatever interests you. He is also accessible outside of class and will explain concepts to you. He is very knowledgeable in many areas of physics and thus a great teacher for this course. The only criticism I have is that the lectures can be somewhat hard to follow at times due to notation inconsistent with the lecture notes or minor notational mistakes. Further the lectures do not comprehensively cover the lecture notes. This is, however, despite what the naysayers falsely have proclaimed, proclaim in this Q and will proclaim ad infinitum not an issue as you have the SUPERB LECTURE NOTES to rely on. They provide detailed derivations of the material and are more than comprehensive.With regards to assignments, the course is relatively easy. There are weekly PSETS that (once again ignore the naysayers) are easy to do with the lecture notes and support from your friends: ChatGPT and Gemini. Yes you heard correctly: generative AI is allowed and its usage is even encouraged in this glorious class. This is part of professor Schwartz's educational doctrine, which I'm very much in support of. Ample extra credit opportunities (such as tempering chocolate) give you a chance to make up for any minor mistakes that happened. Lastly there is a take–home midterm and final, which by their very nature are easy to do. Overall I'm very happy to have taken the course as a Chemistry major over the alternatives the Chemistry department has to offer. There are no pre–requisites. I have not taken any quantum or any proper mechanics. High–school math and physics is all you need, anything else can be learned along the way. The course covers many interesting topics from the basics of stat. mech. over tedious thermodynamics (my hatred has only increased) to interesting applications in semiconductor physics and astrophysics. Once again do not listen to the overly critical voices in this year's Q. From first–hand knowledge I can attest that many of these naysayers did not read the lecture notes or attend lectures, which indeed causes a challenge in understanding the material.",0.9935,Very bashy.

Jordan has set the new standard for teaching 210, par excellence. His deep understanding of general relativity, combined with his philosophical perspective, created a class where I did not merely learn how to compute a bunch of metrics, but to ponder the deep mystery of space and time. Jordan declared his thesis statement at the beginning of the first lecture: Einstein's theory of general relativity gives the definitive explanation of the nature of space and time, a question which had provoked thought for millennia. He developed this thesis throughout the semester. It is my understanding that by the end of February we had covered what past renditions of 210 take the entire semester to do. Despite this, Jordan's lectures felt appropriately paced and incredibly insightful.I especially appreciate how the second half of the course was devoted to topics and applications in GR. Jordan's conjuring of the Ghosts of Universes Past, Present, and Yet–to–Come in the series on cosmology was particularly beautiful. The final lecture may have been the greatest of them all. What I will remember most from this course are the parting words Jordan left for us at the end of the final class. He shared two quotes, one from Einstein and another from Wittgenstein, which were a fitting chiasmus to his opening remarks at the start of the semester. General relativity provides an outlet for wonder more than anything else. It is a theory of singular beauty, yet one which retains a quality bordering on the mystical a century after its inception. That space and time so desperately want to be equals yet are forever distinguished by a single minus sign really makes you wonder. The curvature of spacetime flies in the face of common intuition. Plato writes that what distinguishes knowledge from mere belief is the ability to peer into the realm of Forms and see the underlying, unchanging nature of things. This class teaches you knowledge of the real nature of space, time, matter, and indeed the universe itself. I looked forward to this class every Monday and Wednesday, and hope to cross paths with Jordan again in the future, if our world lines intersect. The Physics Department has done a great job at hiring new faculty in the past few years. It would be a honest shame, and Harvard's loss, if they can't keep Jordan around.",0.9913,,0.0,,0.0

Plus,  spending time with the same people everyday creates a great learning environment where it feels like by the end of the semester you are taking a class with your friends rather than people you met less than two months ago.

Dedicating a whole class to focus on Dante’s masterpiece was definitely a special experience as we could really deeply understand Dante’s purpose and stories. Originally involved with politics, Dante was sent into exile from Florence, upon which he turned to Christianity and realised the corruption within politics and the Church at the time. In a way, the Comedy has been a way for Dante to not only comment on each of the particular deficiencies within society at the time, but also discover the areas in which he falls short, in doing so, commenting on the human condition and exploring what transcends the physical world. Almost all those mentioned in Inferno lived around 200m away from where Dante lived, or they were political or biblical references.This class taught me a lot about the power of storytelling. I had already been interested in literature in classical antiquity, and noticing the intertextuality here with Virgil was magnificent. I think I came to appreciate how literature can preserve stories from thousands of years ago, and it was such a pleasure and privilege to study such a text with such an incredible teaching team and wonderful peers. At the end of the day, this was a course about what it means to live a fulfilling life, close to God, taking in the beauty of humanity’s power for rationality and faith. Literature doesn’t just preserve stories; it preserves humanity itself.The seminars were quite long – nearly 2.5 hours total, so it was slightly hard to fully engage sometimes. But the final project was deeply, deeply fulfilling, and Ambrogio CP is just so open–minded and brilliant of a thinker. He’s deeply introspective and a very critical thinker, so learning from him was such an incredible experience. You really have full creative autonomy in this class and the ability to really engage with medieval literature – this was easily my favourite class this semester.",0.9966,,0.0,,0.0

The written assignments are fun and 4–5.5 pages which means you're not slapping on words to a google doc trying to get to the page limit. The final exam is also super fair, although you did need to study to do well. It was very much like an AP exam.

The Refugee Fieldwork Program offers a possibility for students to deepen the knowledge accumulated in this course while serving communities in need for it over the summer. Only a human who cares deeply about both the topic, not just as something he teaches, but as a part of society he lives to shine light upon would be so invested to create an opportunity like this at Harvard for undergraduates. I cannot imagine a class more worth taking here than this one. You will learn so much about various aspects of forced migration and gain a deep understanding of how different asylum systems work. You will begin to see the issues surrounding forced migration from multiple perspectives and be encouraged to think about feasible solutions to address them. The assignments are super fun and engaging, and quite flexible in the way that you can research deeper the topic in the class that you are most intrigued by, while also being held to the academic standards of how Achraf would call it, ""the next big thing"".

There was, in my opinion, too little elaboration about some really key concepts (we never received explanation about what a t–distribution is, even though t–distributions followed us through like half the course). There was also a lot of unintroduced math terminology that I have to imagine confused people who have taken little–to–no college math, which is many people in this course. Finally, I really think well–known courses owe it to students to announce that they’re changing their focus when they are: I would probably have taken this course anyway if I knew it was going to emphasize statistics more heavily, but that probably wouldn’t have been the case for some others.",-0.9426,Take this class if you want a gem that fulfills your scientific reasoning requirement.

Psets were often released late and there were times that the TFs did not have the full solutions to the psets, making it difficult to help us. Also, pset grades were given back to us very late. This was the first iteration of the course, which I believe explains all those issues, as Kevin had to make up all the material from scratch as the class moved along. Kevin is a really cool teacher, and he presented the information well. We also get into some ML concepts towards the end of the class, which was pretty cool. I am very confident that the next iteration of the course will be great, since all the psets will have been made already, which should fix most (if not all) of the organizational issues.

As a stats concentrator who has taken lots of stats classes in FAS, this was the most unaccountable set of TFs I have ever encountered in the department. They were not held accountable, and I think it’s absolutely unfair to take a class and not even get feedback on a subset of assignments I did. Those TFs should have been replaced during the semester. We got feedback about our final project 48 hours before the due date.

Alex is a great instructor and very knowledgeable on the topic and provides a lot of help in office hours to make the course more accessible. One of the reasons I took this class was because of how highly–recommended Alex was as a professor, and he did not disappoint here. The course was very organized, and lecture notes and assignments were always available on time, and assignments were handed back in a timely manner. In fact, the final exam was graded within 24 hours of its due date. However, the level of math is greater than comparable 100 level courses and may be a bit daunting, so if you don't have a strong math background at the level of Math 112 you may get a bit confused early on in the course, though Alex will do his best to explain these complicated topics at a more simple level since students in the class came from all different backgrounds, ranging from undergraduate sophomores to biostats PhD candidates. The TF, Sarika, was also great, though I'm not sure if she'll be the TF in the next iteration of this class in 2027.The content itself is somewhat hard to motivate, and I felt that I wasn't able to really grasp what was going on or see why it was important. Spatial statistics is still a somewhat esoteric field, though its application to economics is growing. However, it's rooted in geology and mining and so is still largely associated with those fields, though Alex does do a good job of applying it to many different areas. Still, it didn't feel like I was learning as much useful information as I was in my other stats classes, though that may have just been due to the level of math and theory in this class being greater than in other stat courses.I think this course would make a lot more sense to take with a time series background, since it really just extends the concepts from time series (such as autoregression) to multiple dimensions. So taking a class like STAT 171 or 131 before this would be very helpful as well.This class has 7 psets (including a short one due the first week of class), due roughly every other week. The class is split into 3 units (point processes, lattice processes, and geostatistics), so each unit has a theory pset followed by an application pset, so the class keeps a good balance between the two. Alex has ""numerical examples"" available on Canvas that help a lot with the coding (R) psets, and office hours are provided throughout the week to help with these assignments. They are graded generously as well and are worth 65 percent of your grade.The course has no midterm and has a take home final exam, for which office hours are still provided if you need assistance. The take home exam is very reasonable and no more difficult than the psets, so if you understood what you were doing on the psets you'll be fine for the final.Overall, this class probably won't be the most stressful for you due to its pset/exam structure and may be a more chill way to learn about these extensions of linear modeling. However, you might want to take a look into what spatial statistics covers to tell if you'd enjoy taking this course and to tell how much you'd take away from it.",0.993,,0.0,,0.0

I'll discuss the pros and cons of this class, and why you might (not) want to choose it over 139/244. This review will be quite long but should answer basically any question you have about the course and be sufficient to decide whether it is a course that you'd like to take.Required preparation: You can do well in this class even if your only preparation is STAT 110. We do use likelihoods and MLEs quite a bit throughout the class, so 111 would definitely be helpful, but is not completely necessary. Presumably you're taking this class if you're a stat concentrator though, so you will have probably taken 111 anyway. Lastly, 139 is by no means needed for this class, hence why 149 can substitute for it in the modeling requirement for the stats concentration. I think around half of the people in 149 this semester did not take 139. However, I would strongly recommend taking 139 as well if you plan to take this course, as it really does not make conceptual sense to learn basically every type of generalized linear model except for a standard linear regression with normally–distributed errors (which is the focus of 139). This course will also be far more satisfying having completed 139 and you will be able to more clearly see why we are doing certain things. Some topics are also retaught from scratch from 139, so you'll be slightly ahead having completed that before this course.Content: The course covers different generalized linear models (e.g. logistic regression, Poisson regression, multinomial regression) as well as some extensions beyond these models, including some more ML–related topics (smoothers, GAMs, decision trees) and related non–GLMs (negative binomial, beta–binomial, proportional odds). The theoretical basis for this class is rooted in exponential dispersion families (essentially NEFs if you remember those from 111), and their log–likelihoods/MLEs. We touch on topics such as model selection, diagnostics, and missing data methods as well.Course structure: Mark is a great professor and is very well–organized. Lecture notes are well–written and contain basically everything you need to complete the homeworks and do well on exams. If you don't want to attend a 9 AM lecture twice a week, the lecture notes (or the Panopto recording) are entirely sufficient. In fact, you can complete nearly everything on the homework assignments solely with the lecture notes (and associated R script provided on Canvas). Lecture notes and homeworks will be posted far in advance in contrast to some other stats courses where homeworks are released late or not at all. There are office hours and sections provided, though sections were sparsely attended since the lecture notes are so well–written and self–contained, and since the course enrollment was relatively small. If you come to lecture or watch the recordings, you will probably not need to go to section.Homeworks: There are 6 regular homework assignments throughout the semester, due roughly every other week on Monday. As I mentioned, they can be completed basically with just the lecture notes. They are mostly applied and in R, though there will occasionally be more theoretical questions. However, these assignments are very straightforward and should not require that much stress or time. Mark guides you through the applied problems and so you'll almost never have to look up an obscure command to do something. These assignments should take no more than 2 or 3 hours if you're referring to the lecture notes for guidance.Mini–projects: In addition to the 6 regular homeworks, there are also 3 ""mini–projects"" which are really just additional psets, but the mini–projects have you explore one dataset 3 times throughout the second half of the semester to implement tools as we learn them in class. So in reality this class has 9 homework assignments, but these mini–projects are slightly shorter than regular homeworks and usually due in the weeks in between the due dates of two homeworks. They also only start in the second half of the class, following spring break and the first midterm.Exams: This class has 2 exams: a midterm and a final. However, it's more accurate to describe them as Midterm 1 and Midterm 2, as they are both the same length (75 minutes). Midterm 2 is notably not cumulative which is why it is still only 75 minutes long (though still held during finals period), though in reality you learn so many more things in the second half of the class that it not being cumulative doesn't really change anything, and you will still need to have a strong understanding of many of the concepts from the first half anyway. The exams are not really that tricky and mostly test interpretation of model outputs and related concepts. There are some theoretical concepts covered on exams, though no more so than computing a log likelihood or an MLE. However, there are some more obscure formulas required to complete certain parts that are not provided to you, so it's a good thing that you're allowed to bring in a cheat sheet for the exams. Make sure that you make a good cheat sheet or you may lose out on a large number of points because you didn't have the right formula written down on your cheat sheet (i.e. Newton–Raphson or an F test statistic). Exam averages hovered around 70 percent, not too much different from 110/111, though the exams in this class were definitely far easier and more predictable than those. If you take the practice exams, review the lecture notes, and make a good cheat sheet, you should be fine.Grade distribution: About half the class gets a final grade in the A range, and about half in the B range. But again, if you put in a decent level of effort and stay on top of the class, you should be able to get an A range grade. Mark is very fair in how he determines and curves grades, so it is really only if you are unable or unwilling to dedicate enough time and effort to the class (which is again, far less than 110/111) that you would do worse than you'd have liked to.Overall workload: I rarely spent more than 2 or 3 hours each week outside of class on 149. Homework assignments were very straightforward and could be quickly completed using the lecture notes. This workload increased the weeks of the two exams, though you probably don't need to do much more than review the lecture notes and homeworks, make your cheat sheet, and complete the practice exams.Now that I've summarized the class, I'll address whether one should take it over 139 or 244.139  vs 149: 149 is essentially an extension of 139 and allows for far more flexibility in modeling than what 139 does with OLS regression. That being said, 149 can reasonably be taken without any knowledge from 139 and is actually an easier/less time consuming class than 139 (you can verify this by comparing Q guides). So if you just want to get this modeling requirement out of the way and maybe if you have a very busy fall schedule, 149 may be preferable. But if you want to have a complete, widely–applicable knowledge base of understanding, you'd be best off taking both 139 and 149. While there are some redundancies between the two, taking both gives you basically everything you need to statistically model basically anything. Another little–discussed note of importance is that 149 is approved as an Econ elective (as of Spring 2025) while 139 is not, which may be of interest to Stat–Econ double concentrators.149 vs 244: 149 is a very applied class and does not get too much into the weeds of the more theoretical concepts. It is mainly focused on interpreting results and choosing the appropriate model. While this means 149 is very applicable, if you're more theory–oriented you may want to take 244 instead, which combines 139 and 149 into one graduate–level class heavy in linear algebra, calculus, and proofs. It also meets the modeling requirement, but does not cover all of the application discussed in 139 and 149. So I'd recommend 244 only if you're more interested in the theory (and perhaps going for advanced course track honors/concurrent masters). Though you can of course take 139/149 and then take 244 as well if you'd like, which is what I plan to do.Overall, you should consider taking 149 if you want a low–stress yet extremely useful class where you'll learn a lot without having the class feel like a burden on your schedule.",0.998,,0.0,,0.0

The psets are manageable towards the end they just became textbook problems which are significantly easier, and there are lots of office hours and support. I will say that sometimes it was hard to get a clear gauge on what the exams would be like, because there would be challenging content in lecture, then easy things on the psets, and then medium questions on the section notes, and then really hard practice exam problems so it was unclear what we should be preparing for and what the expectations for the exam actually were.

So here are my thoughts (mostly for undergrads, PhDs are welcome to skip this essay as you are forced to take this class):My preparation: I am a junior who took Math 25A/B, Stat 210, and 211. I had not taken Stat 212 or any other math course before taking 213. I don’t think a deep understanding of measure theory is really needed for this course, but I’m sure it helps if you have one.Material: 4.6/5. The material is very foundational and if you are very interested in statistics (which you probably are given you are reading the 213 Qguide in the first place), you will love it. The course is broadly divided into three parts: estimation (the longest one comprising most of the semester), hypothesis test, and Bayesian inference (which lasts for about a week).Starting with estimation, the first few weeks on the unit can be rather dry. In the words of Pragya herself, she doesn’t exactly like the material in these weeks due to them feeling more analysis–y than statistics–y and I completely agree; the number of assumptions in some theorems is so large that they become a pain to check through whenever you are working on homework. I don’t think these weeks were bad by any means, but they were definitely not the best either.These problems mostly end by the time we discuss QMD, which may seem like the bashiest, why–does–this–exist definition when you first learn them, but you will quickly learn how useful they are for the rest of the semester; it’s actually astonishing how much QMD gets used as the most important assumption in so many theorems despite how ugly the definition is. So the estimation unit is basically divided into two halves: the first half which is dry and the second half which utilizes QMD. So if you have hatred for analysis, you may not like the course at the beginning, but I do promise that it will get better as it goes on.For the hypothesis test unit, Pragya does a great job at explaining why we should test the asymptotic power of different hypothesis testing methods using an alternative that gets harder and harder as the sample size increases. The motivation is great, and using LeCam’s Third Lemma to get results for this is pretty satisfying. The one issue I had however is that we don’t exactly derive many ways to get the asymptotic power under the alternatives in class nor in the notes. For example, for the Likelihood–Ratio Test, we learned about the asymptotic distribution of the test statistic under the null, but we didn’t really discuss what happens under a sequence of alternatives except in the problem set where we did it only for the Gaussian case. It would have been helpful to better integrate the measure theory that came before this because as it stands, it doesn’t feel like I learned that much about how to find the power under sequences of alternatives. Nonetheless, a great unit; also extending the idea of a most powerful test to an asymptotically most powerful test was very interesting.Finally, for the Bayesian unit: It needs to be longer. One week of Bayesian statistics that virtually only aims to prove the Bernstein–von–Mises Theorem really doesn’t provide much at all for Bayesian statistics. I do get that this is supposed to be a foundational course and statistics began mostly from a frequentist perspective, but I definitely think that as a class that is supposed to prepare PhDs for research, it should give a wider view of Bayesian inference. This may be difficult to do since the material is pretty packed already, but I definitely think that the estimation unit was too long and some parts of it (example: perhaps proof of asymptotic normality of MLE? It is an important result but the proof was long and felt unmotivated for the most part.) can be cut to give some more room for Bayesian stuff. I enjoyed what existed of Bayesian inference in the course nevertheless.Lectures: 4.8/5. Pragya is a great lecturer and makes it incredibly obvious that she knows what she is talking about. She also occasionally makes jokes that integrate into what she was talking about perfectly, which gives the lectures a little spark that I’ve only seen Pragya be able to accomplish. The only complaint I have is that the lectures can be a bit dry sometimes (especially in the estimation unit), but this mostly just occurs on topics that are dry in the first place.Problem Sets: 4.3/5. There are biweekly problem sets, and there are 5 total with one drop. Let me make this clear: Unless you are more of a math major than a statistics major (even then I feel this may apply), Stat 213 is NOT easier than Stat 211. The problem sets are less of “find the one hard–to–see trick” that Stat 211 often employed. The difficulty of Stat 213 homework comes from the difficulty of the material itself (not to say Stat 211 had easy material, but it was definitely easier than 213). Stat 213 material is packed and we don’t go over applications to all of the theorems; these applications are moved to the problem sets, and this can make the homework very difficult. This isn’t really problematic, but just something you should be aware of going into this course. As for grading, I would sometimes lose points for “formality,” but I’m not sure exactly where the formality points lie as they can be very subjective and the staff solutions can seem short and less formal as well. Another thing to be aware of.One thing I should mention though: I utterly failed to befriend PhD students in this class, so I basically worked on the problem sets alone. I’m sure the homework is a lot easier if you are less introverted than me and actually get to know some PhD students lol.However, one big problem that makes my opinion of problem sets be lower than it deserves: The first two problems in the fourth assignment were in the section notes. I didn’t realize this, so I basically had to solve this from scratch. This leads to two outcomes, both of which are problematic: 1. Someone who didn’t read the section notes tries to solve the problem. Then they are disadvantaged by those who did read it. 2. Someone who did read the section notes copies the solution. Then they are disadvantaged by the fact they didn’t really learn from the problem. Either way, this is a problem; I strongly believe that no problem presented in section should be on the homework. These two problems weren’t exactly the hardest problems in problem sets so it isn’t as bad as it could have been, but something to keep in mind for the course heading forward.My advice for undergrads: TL;DR: If you are in the following set, I would recommend taking the course:{Took analysis} \cap (({Interested in stats} \cap {Took measure theory}) \cup {REALLY interested in stats}) \cap {Have time for this course}. I was in the {REALLY interested in stats} set and not in the {Took measure theory} set (which made it more challenging for me), and I have no regrets about taking this course. It’s very foundational and the material is legitimately interesting. I still love the way sequences of more difficult alternative hypotheses were presented as well as how much QMD can be used for good results. If you really love statistics, I can’t see yourself not enjoying this course. So unless you think this course will be too much of a hassle with your schedule, take it! I would also recommend taking it your sophomore/junior year as it can be difficult to manage this your senior year especially if you want to write a thesis. But definitely have a Plan B in case you find this class to be overwhelming.And be warned: There are 24 hour take–home midterm and final, and those are brutal.That concludes my essay. Hopefully any undergrads reading this found it helpful.For Pragya: Thank you for a great semester! I’m sure I wasn’t the most talented undergrad you’ve had during your time teaching this course (I would actually bet I’m the least talented undergrad you’ve had in this course lol), but I truly enjoyed Stat 213 and the material was so interesting.

The paper also talks about some social/public policy concerns that have arisen with stem cell therapy, like equitable access, non–FDA approved therapies in the Caribbean, 'my sister's keeper'–esque family planning with IVF, and more, so it's not just hard science 24/7 which I appreciated.

Because there are so many topics covered (it was generally divided by organs/diseases,  like brain, cardiovascular, diabetes, embryos, etc) , it means there's something for everyone. The paper also talks about some social/public policy concerns that have arisen with stem cell therapy, like equitable access, non–FDA approved therapies in the Caribbean, 'my sister's keeper'–esque family planning with IVF, and more, so it's not just hard science 24/7 which I appreciated. The weekly paper write–ups are graded semi–harshly with the goal of helping you refine your analysis of papers—I actually feel like I improved a lot in this aspect over the course of the semester and my grade was generally fine. The professors are both very well–connected in the medical/research/pharma world so the guest speakers are highly credentialed and super interesting. The con of this is that the professors are really busy and your actual learning (weekly paper roundtables, advice on your proposal) are all directed by a TF. It's harder to build a relationship with the professors.
