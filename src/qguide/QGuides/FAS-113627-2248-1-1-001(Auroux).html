			<td class="TabularBody_LeftColumn" headers="comment-2_e53e2c9d-bf32-4403-baa7-6fddd95ac1d3">DO I RECOMMEND THIS CLASS?<br/>I remain neutral, and I honestly don’t think my personal opinion could affect prospective 55ers either. One thing is for certain: do listen to your heart. If you really like math and wanna test out your love for it, then go ahead and don’t be scared. Worst case scenario you take it and realize math is not gonna be rest of your life. Well, you can now step onto other paths without regret. But if you want to take the class without motivations related with math, don’t. People (including me) write long Q&ndash;reports because we spent a lot of time on it. In the end, it is still just a course: you can’t really ask much more than what a class has to offer. <br/><br/>SUGGESTIONS<br/>1.	Do a brief, overall reading of textbooks beforehand:<br/>  downloaded Axler almost immediately after getting in, and did not start reading until the semester started: very bad idea. If you can, do some readings and have an overall understanding of what’s going to happen. Don’t try to understand everything in the first shot: it’s gonna be too much time. <br/>2.	Collaboration is important, and also try not to free load too much<br/>It’s a tough time trying to solve everything on your own, and it’s also tempting to become porters and not generators of answers… <br/>3.	Go to lectures and pay attention<br/> Prof Auroux’s lectures are worthwhile, and 10:30am is definitely doable. It’s harder to figure everything out on your own. <br/><br/>THINGS I GAINED IN THIS CLASS:<br/>1.	Intelligence<br/>Math 55 is a semester long speed endurance training for brains. I ran at 80&ndash;90% my max brain capacity, and maintain this speed for 20+ hours a week without fully recovering in between. It is one of the few times in my life that I actually feel myself becoming more clever.<br/>2.	Mental Resilience: <br/>I often read the textbook over and over telling myself meanwhile that it&#x27;s normal (hopefully) and I’m not an idiot. There’re crazily intelligent people in this class, and it can be discouraging seeing someone solving the problem that you thought for 6+ hours in 20 minutes. It’s okay. Everyone blossoms at different places and seasons of life.<br/>3.	Physical Resilience: (Strictly Not Recommended)<br/>It’s definitely a life&ndash;transforming experience to stay up all night, submit pset, eat breakfast and go to 9am lecture all in a row. Such moments suck, and they happened because of my own fault. You can totally maintain a healthy lifestyle with math 55, and please do so.<br/>4.	Good friends: This class brought us together, and we extended the friendship beyond math. I am truly grateful that I have met them. <br/>5.	Coffee Machine. According to Prof Auroux, &#x27;you should consider becoming a math concentrator because of this very good coffee machine&#x27;. <br/><br/>PERSONAL TAKEAWAYS:<br/>These are very subjective takeaways, so FYI this is a bit about myself: I learned nothing beyond Calc BC, I am familiar with proofs and did national math olympiad. I’m planning to major in math&#x2F;math adjacent but not going to academia. I’m interested in humanities especially philosophy. Math was and only was part of my life. For me Math 55a is a very challenging and fruitful class. It altered my sloppy attitude towards math and forced me into a more resilient person. I spend 25&ndash;30 hours a week on problem sets.<br/>1.	I actually like math. It sounds a bit sarcastic from someone that started competition math from 8th grade, but is real. From my high school I met (too) many math geniuses and was discouraged, thinking effort could never surpass talent. This class taught me that attitude matters a lot, and people that work hard actually excel in this class. There’s much more I could do before calling it a day. <br/>2.	I should have spent more time on this class. Surely you can do math 55 with other challenging classes and&#x2F;or clubs: People take math 55 with physics 16&#x2F;stat 110&#x2F;cs 1210 including myself, and there are also people in very intensive clubs. I also went through whole comping process of many clubs but quit more than half of them. Looking back, I was just trying to cram in as much stuff in my first semester as possible, and neglected the quality I should put on each of them. Harvard indeed has very abundant opportunities, but given another chance I would slow down and start solid.<br/>3.	I should have had more friends not in math. Maybe my love for math isn’t deep enough, I feel scared if my life is built around one single pivot. <br/><br/>SPECIAL THANKS<br/>1.	Professor Denis Auroux. His great sense of humor, spectacular talent in lecturing, legendary homework hints, always timely Slack&#x2F; email responses, understanding of special conditions… all made this intro journey to serious math much more fun and accessible.<br/>2.	CAs. The grade returning speed is insane, and the help is so nice. You made this journey so much warmer.<br/>3.	People in this class. This journey is incomplete without any of you, and I really enjoy my time spent with you all in the class&#x2F; office hours&#x2F; math lounge.<br/>4.	My friends. There’s no way I could pull through this semester without you. I can&#x27;t express my thanks enough.</td>

As someone with no prior experience in pretty much all the material in the class, let me be the first to tell you it will take up a large portion of your life. I have spent many late nights psetting, going through the textbook trying to understand what is going on. I was really intimidated in the first few lectures. Use those to help inform whether this class is for you or not. Be mindful to only take this class if you really like math and am willing to spend a lot of time on it.</td>

			<td class="TabularBody_LeftColumn" headers="comment-2_e53e2c9d-bf32-4403-baa7-6fddd95ac1d3">This is an absolutely phenomenal course with a wide range of benefits. First of all, the content you learn is completely unrivaled for a freshman math course, in terms of both breadth and depth. The course covers set theory, group theory, linear algebra, and representation theory, all with the same depth as a class exclusively devoted to each; in effect, it&#x27;s about two and a half full semesters of material in the course of a semester. This doesn&#x27;t even come at the cost of lower depth of understanding; the lectures by Prof. Auroux are fascinating and always very digestible for the difficulty of the concepts being presented, and the homework assignments are full of fascinating problems that really make you think about the content that you&#x27;re learning, so you don&#x27;t just get a surface level overview of all of these different areas of math, but rather a deep and rich understanding of each, and a solid appreciation for how they connect and interact. Secondly, the community is amazing, and it&#x27;s a great way to get introduced to the Harvard Math Dept., whether or not you plan on concentrating in Math. While the reputation of Math 55 students as pretentious, overcompetitive and exclusionary does occasionally hold true, the vast majority of students are kind, accepting, and just overall incredibly passionate about math, as well as a wide range of other academic topics. It&#x27;s very easy to find a study group to work on the problem sets together so you don&#x27;t get overwhelmed trying to fight through them on your own, and it&#x27;s a good way to make upperclassman math concentrator friends as well, either through the CA&#x27;s, or through time spent in the Math Lounge. On that note, the teaching staff of this course is phenomenal as well. The CA&#x27;s, of which there are normally quite a few, are very accessible, helpful, and just as passionate about math as the students in the course. And Prof. Auroux is an incredible teacher with a dedication to the course which is impossible to overstate; if you have a question, comment, or even just are struggling and want to reach out to someone, he always has incredibly short response times over Slack or email, and is always ready with a helpful hint, a useful bit of knowledge, or a word of support. His lectures are fun, engaging, and you will always, ALWAYS learn something, even if you think you know the material that&#x27;s being covered. Overall, this is an amazing course with a wide range of strengths.</td>

			<td class="TabularBody_LeftColumn" headers="comment-2_e53e2c9d-bf32-4403-baa7-6fddd95ac1d3">It’s no secret that 55 is a difficult class, but if you’re seriously considering the course, you already know that. If you’re on the fence, you should definitely just enroll. 55 is invaluable for the amount of math it teaches you in a semester (a bit more than two classes’ worth) and the degree it can improve you as a mathematician within that time. Professor Auroux is a great lecturer — a lot of people end up skipping class because the lecture notes are posted to Canvas,  but you really do miss out on how well he explains things during class — and is super friendly and helpful in office hours. The CAs are also great and are very helpful in office hours, whether on HWs or just general advice. The community the class builds is also amazing, and you’ll meet so many really smart people with really diverse interests. You definitely need to be prepared to let the class take over your life a bit — HWs and exams are difficult and time consuming — but the reward is well worth the effort if you are really interested. On that point, definitely don’t take the class just for the clout (if that’s your only motivation, it’s going to be a really tough time), but ANYONE who seriously loves math and has even a vague sense that they might be able to succeed in this class should definitely enroll.</td>

Otherwise, don&#x27;t underestimate the opportunity cost of your time. You will be dedicating a big chunk of every week to this course, and that time might be better used in other endeavors if you aren&#x27;t really getting the most out of the course.</td>

			<td class="TabularBody_LeftColumn" headers="comment-2_e53e2c9d-bf32-4403-baa7-6fddd95ac1d3">This course is an amazing experience. The material is fascinating and problem sets are well&ndash;constructed. There are ample resources for learning the material, between lecture notes, textbooks, and office hours with the professor and the course assistants. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever learned so much in a single course in my life. The main differences between Math 55 and the other math course options are the incredibly fast pace and the level of abstraction. In terms of the pace, it will definitely help if you have experience with linear algebra (and some group theory is a bonus), but this really comes down to how much time you want to invest in the class. Developing the mathematical maturity to handle the abstraction is harder, but very rewarding. It will also help if you&#x27;ve had experience with proof writing.<br/><br/>I&#x27;m very glad I took this course, because there is an incredible community (you will probably be spending lots of time around the other most mathematically&ndash;inclined students on campus) and it has given me a very strong foundation to pretty much go in any direction I want with math. Even in higher level math courses, you won&#x27;t find the same experience that exists with Math 55. <br/><br/>This course is objectively quite difficult. It&#x27;s not for everyone, and if you find yourself relying too much on other people to get through the first couple problem sets then you might be better off in a different class. But it&#x27;s worth trying! I was on the fence about taking Math 55 but I found that I was actually very well&ndash;prepared for the class.</td>

If you&#x27;re on the fence about this course, as I was, my advice is... don&#x27;t be. If you&#x27;re even considering the course, I highly recommend shopping it. When you go to class the first week, you&#x27;ll know if this is something that you want to dedicate time to.

If you are reading this, it is highly probable that you are a freshmen interested in math &ndash; not only interested but you have a considerable background in competitive math (math olympiads, math contests, BC, etc.). I would first of all say that don&#x27;t overthink. Take it or not, you are going to survive. You came to Harvard and especially if you applied from math&#x2F;applied math, this means that you have what it takes to take this class. If you earned any achievements in math olympiads (even if national), don&#x27;t worry, you can take this course and manage it fine IF you commit to spare time to it. Some familiarity with modular arithmetic would suffice as background. Worst case: you can always drop to a lighter course in the first three weeks without penalty. If you would like to go for a light freshmen year (yes, year, because you are going to most likely take Math 55b as well), I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this course.<br/>Personally, this course made me feel smarter in every aspect of life as it gives a strong intuition about the abstraction of concrete cases. Definitely try to make as many friends as you can as collaboration is not only allowed but encouraged in this course. This is perhaps the or at least one of the most elite math communities at Harvard. Go for it (but balance it with some light courses like geneds or intro courses). Don&#x27;t worry if you don&#x27;t get everything that is being taught in the lecture, it will be fine &ndash; it is fine to let some things go; however, make sure to form a solid understanding of the main definitions (groups, representations, eigenvalues, etc.) and basic principles.<br/>Strongly recommend it (with reservations) if you are a math&ndash;enjoyer.</td>

As a Harvard professor in the esteemed Math 55 course—the hardest course in all of Harvard&#x27;s mathematics department—he stood at the front of his classroom one bright Tuesday morning, explaining the intricacies of Sylow’s theorems to a group of students who looked far too enthusiastic for 10:30 a.m. As he was explaining the third theorem, something unexpected happened. The door to the lecture hall creaked open. A group of students entered, laughing loudly. Denis, used to the chaos that sometimes entered through those doors, didn’t think much of it at first. However, as he glanced up, he realized that these weren’t just any students. The five of them—wearing jeans, oversized jackets, and the kind of casual swagger that could make any professor question their career choices—had arrived, and it was like a hurricane of energy had suddenly hit the room. At the front of the group was a tall, charismatic young man with a messy head of brown hair and a pair of glasses that somehow looked like they belonged on a rockstar. He grinned at Denis, who, caught off guard, fumbled slightly with his chalk. “Sorry we’re late, Professor. I’m Harry, by the way. And this is Niall, Louis, Zayn, and Liam. Group theory is so much more interesting than I expected! I mean, who knew that groups were so important? Like, you really can apply this stuff to anything! It’s kind of like... well, life itself, right?&quot; Denis, in his usual way, turned his brown orbs and the conversation back to the equations on the board. &quot;Right. Life is like a group—a set with a binary operation, closed, associative, and with an identity element.&quot; He paused, glancing over at Harry. &quot;And just like groups, life can sometimes be... complicated.&quot; The class chuckled. Another student, Draco Malfoy, was clearly more interested in Denis’s dry humor than in group theory itself. “Professor, you’re saying life is a group? Does that mean we can break it into subgroups?” Denis, slightly taken aback by the question, smirked. “I suppose you could say that. But life can be conjugated by an infinite number of elements. The subgroups may not always be normal.”</td>

Auroux is an amazing lecturer, and a super nice guy. I look forward to every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday of the week just because I get to go to lecture for this class. <br/><br/>While having experience with abstract math is certainly helpful, the only prerequisite you really need for Math 55 is a willingness to put a lot of your week into doing math. I know a lot of girls especially don&#x27;t take 55 because they believe they&#x27;re unqualified.

In addition, it cannot be overstated how much you learn from the other students in this class and 55 really does a great job of fostering a community in the math department.

			<td class="TabularBody_LeftColumn" headers="comment-2_e53e2c9d-bf32-4403-baa7-6fddd95ac1d3">Now, to get it out of the way, yes, this class is stupidly difficult. The analogy of drinking water from a firehose is not at all inaccurate and I would not recommend taking it alongside more than one other really difficult course (like physics 16,CS61 from what I&#x27;ve heard for example) &ndash; it is possible, but it will likely crush you. One other really difficult course is doable if you&#x27;re very comfortable with, I have friends that have done it, but they were in a position where those courses were very commensurate with their skill level. Nonetheless, despite the extreme difficulty, I would still recommend this course as strongly as I am capable if you love math. You do NOT have to be a genius with boatloads of competition mathematics experience in order to take this class. The highest level of mathematics I ever did formally in high school was single variable calculus and the basics of complex numbers and some very very elementary proofs, and I was still able to score above average in the course without sacrificing my entire life on its altar. I would however say that it is quite difficult to do well in the class without at least one of the following:<br/>&ndash; Some experience in high school with more advanced mathematics, especially linear algebra. This is not so much because it will directly come up as something tested in the course, as although we do spend a lot of time on linear algebra it takes a form almost unrecognizable to many of my friends who did linear algebra in high school, but rather because it gives useful intuition as to how to think concretely about very abstract concepts, and a concrete example to reach for when you want to play around with a new idea. <br/>&ndash; Exposure to and interest in abstract mathematics. This was what I had that I felt helped me the most. This doesn&#x27;t need to be formal &ndash; most of my background came from a nigh&ndash;unhealthy amount of mathematics youtube videos watched as well as having worked through the beginnings of several lecture notes covering the beginnings of a couple of the university&ndash;level subjects I was interested in. These do not need to be directly related to the course material at all, but rather help get you in the mindset of abstract mathematics &ndash; figuring out how to set up a proof, how to see the kinds of patterns and tricks that come up in abstract math, and also just to enjoy the little references to other fields of mathematics that often come up. The course basically assumes being comfortable with this mode of thinking and although you can pick it up along the way, trial by fire and all that, it does help to have it already.<br/><br/>With that out of the way, a final couple notes on the difficulty of the course: firstly, although it is indeed incredibly difficult, that difficulty is fairly frontloaded in that it doesn&#x27;t get too much worse than the first couple problem sets (not that it gets much easier either, but it does mean that if you survive the first couple weeks without completely burning yourself up you can likely survive the rest) and secondly, again despite that difficulty the grading is relatively lenient, and as long as you solve the problems you will likely score quite well. This is especially true of the fact that extensive collaboration is tolerated and actively encouraged by the course &ndash; it becomes much much more manageable once you find a good problem set group to work through it with and the scope of what kind of collaboration is permitted is quite broad. <br/><br/>A tip on study groups &ndash; try and find a group with a roughly comparable skill level to yours in the class, as being in a problem set group with someone much more or less mathematically able than you is generally not very productive for either party. This also helps with another issue that I found to be quite common: impostor syndrome. Since many people taking this course would have been the resident math whiz at their high school but are just another student in this class it can often be easy to feel as if you don&#x27;t really deserve to be in the class, and having a group of people around you who are going through the same sort of thing and have a similar skill level to you can really help with that. That said, it also helps to have a group of people whose skills complement each other &ndash; the joke in my pset group was always that we had the logician (me), the physicist, and the generalist mathematician, and our respective orientations helped a lot with building solutions together; I could often spot slight technicalities that the other two missed, the physicist had very strong concrete intuitions for things and could see angles we couldn&#x27;t, and the generalist mathematician often had a lot of insights that I was too deep in the weeds to see and that weren&#x27;t the physicist&#x27;s style. <br/><br/>Now as to the professor. I do not exaggerate when I say Denis Auroux is the BEST professor I have ever had in any academic context. He is a brilliant, lucid lecturer who takes incredibly deep, intricate concepts that I personally would have had to spend many times the number of hours we had to understand otherwise and makes them crystal clear and motivated. He always makes sure to really work through the details of why a result is true while keeping it approachable and comprehensible, which is a terribly difficult balance to strike. He was also eminently available to all of his students &ndash; he generally responds to slack questions within minutes (he&#x27;s so quick that it&#x27;s become something of a joke amongst classmates) and his office hours are pure gold. He makes a conscious effort in them to make sure every single question is heard and answered throughly and he gives incredibly well thought out hints. One can also very clearly tell how much he cares about his students &ndash; he takes the time to get to know each of their idiosyncrasies and work with them. He&#x27;s also just very approachable and willing to laugh with you. The CAs are also as a whole excellent, giving incredibly useful advice on the problems and having office hours on all but one day of the week.<br/><br/>As for the content, it is incredibly deep and interesting (although in order to cover so much it is done at incredibly breakneck pace). The main areas covered are group theory (up to and including the Sylow approach to classification of finite groups), abstract linear algebra (with a stringent focus on doing things rigorously and thoroughly, which makes it look very different to the kind of linear algebra many will have done in high school since we don&#x27;t do much at all with matrix computations, for example even defining the determinant is the last thing we do in the linear algebra section of the course), and their intersection in the form of representation theory. This is covered in the lectures, but a lot of the growth in the course happens in the problem sets. These are generally 8&ndash;12 questions in length and will unless you are really brilliant take you most of the week to solve &ndash; finishing a math 55 pset is always a bright moment in the week. The problems are very rarely computational and often force you to be very creative in coming up with a solution. The advantage fo this very heavy problem set workload though is tat generally speaking because they force you to become so intimately familiar with the material in order to solve them you generally have to do very little studying outside of just doing the problem sets.<br/><br/>Finally, I just want to issue a final recommendation to please, if you do love math, TAKE THIS COURSE. It will be hard, it will eat up a lot of your time, but you will come out a better mathematician than I daresay any other class at any other university could have made you. I can deal with mathematical problems and concepts now that I could never have even begun to wrap my head around before taking this course, and I am much more confident in my ability to actually contribute to complex math. Furthermore, the content itself is just too beautiful to pass up &ndash; you will prove results just in the problem sets that are themselves substantial and will make you wonder at the beauty of math. There are very few other experiences that have made me marvel at the sheer beauty of the thing quite as much as math 55. It has been hands down my favourite course of my first semester and quite possibly my favourite academic experience full stop. If you love math and are willing to really put a lot of time into it and want to beecome a better mathematician, this course will be life&ndash;changing. There is nothing else quite like math 55.</td>

			<td class="TabularBody_LeftColumn" headers="comment-2_e53e2c9d-bf32-4403-baa7-6fddd95ac1d3">If you are thinking about taking Math 55, the most important thing is to have clear expectations about what this class is and isn&#x27;t. In particular, you should try to understand whether this class fits your personal goals and how you want to spend your first year at Harvard. One part of this is gauging how well your goals match those of the people who write these reports. For context, I did a lot of math in high school (on the competition front, I qualified for the USAJMO), but I never did college&ndash;level or proof&ndash;based math. I do not plan on going into academia, but I plan on studying math and&#x2F;or something math&ndash;adjacent. Furthermore, I am interested in social sciences and education.<br/><br/>I want to clarify that there is nothing special about Math 55 — you learn standard undergraduate math but at a much faster rate. The first semester covers the equivalent of Math 122 and Math 25a, and in particular, it covers linear algebra very abstractly with little emphasis on application. At times, the class sometimes felt even too fast to appreciate the results that we learned. However, you will develop a lot of mathematical maturity, and you will learn group theory and linear algebra fairly well. Students who have been exposed to higher&ndash;level math will of course have an easier time with the material. If you do not have this background (e.g., you have completed up to AP Calculus BC), I think you should be fine, as long as you have strong problem&ndash;solving skills and are willing to put in the time for the course. You will also have your classmates as well as Professor Auroux and the CAs to get help from.<br/><br/>Naturally, you will spend a lot of time doing math. I estimate that I spent about 1–2 hours reviewing each lecture, and then about 25–30 hours per week on the homework. The midterm and final are both take&ndash;home and take a fair amount of time, but they should be fine if you have understood the course material well. If this is your only demanding class, I think Math 55 is more than doable and you can get a lot out of the material. However, if you are taking other challenging courses, you should think carefully about whether this is the right balance for you. Again, there is nothing special about Math 55, and if you are interested in math, you can learn the same material (maybe even better) in Math 22a &#x2F; 25a and Math 122 separately.<br/><br/>The other aspect to consider is how much Math 55 aligns with your goals more broadly at Harvard. I was fairly confident that I did not want to study pure math down the road, but I took the class primarily as a challenge and because I think math is fun. However, while I do not regret taking the course, I feel that I could have spent more time doing interesting clubs or putting time into my other coursework. For people who are very interested in pure math and&#x2F;or academia, I think Math 55 is a great way to sink your teeth into math in your first year. If you have strong interests outside of math or academics, I urge you to look into other opportunities at Harvard. In any case, you should be prepared for math to be a large part of your semester, and to make some sacrifices to your extracurriculars or social life. Again, Professor Auroux and the CAs are great resources and want you to succeed, but the pacing of the course remains challenging and demands your attention.<br/><br/>Lastly, I want to elaborate on the social aspect of Math 55. In contrast with what has been written before, the class is fairly large and did not feel cult&ndash;y to me as some have described. However, the culture of the class is very math&ndash;centric — to put it bluntly, many conversations with 55&#x27;ers outside of class end up revolving around math anyway, which I did not find enjoyable. You naturally end up spending a lot of time with your classmates, and it can be hard to get out of the clique&ndash;iness of the class. I did become genuinely close with some of my classmates, who I am now good friends with regardless of us taking Math 55. However, the majority of my friends are not in this class, which took a conscious effort on my behalf. If you love math and want to be around others who feel the same, there is no shortage of that in Math 55. If you are considering this class but don&#x27;t necessarily want your social life to revolve around it, I urge you to expand outside of the class and see what else is going on at Harvard.<br/><br/>I hope that this clarifies some of the expectations you may have before taking Math 55. If you are excited to learn math and want to spend a lot of time around it, then Math 55 is right for you. If you find that your goals are slightly different, then this course can still be right if you know what you&#x27;re signing up for. Just keep in mind that there is nothing magical about it, and there are many other cool things and cool people around Harvard.</td>

			<td class="TabularBody_LeftColumn" headers="comment-2_e53e2c9d-bf32-4403-baa7-6fddd95ac1d3">Here is a four&ndash;part test for whether this class is a good fit for you: if a) you have enough time in your schedule for about 15&ndash;20 hours of work outside of class per week, b) you can mostly follow the first couple of lectures, c) you can solve the easier questions on the first problem set without significant external help, and d) most importantly, engaging with challenging mathematics brings you joy, then I strongly recommend taking 55.<br/><br/>There is so much to learn in this course. Personally, no other experience during my fall semester pushed me to engage so deeply with ideas, or was nearly as thorough an exercise of problem&ndash;solving skills and creativity. You get to see and work with some beautiful, insanely cool mathematics. People describe taking 55 as an immensely tiring endeavor, yet even more so an energizing one. Tiring in a rewarding way, like putting a ton of effort into something profoundly fulfilling. The amount of mathematical growth one can experience through this class is astounding.<br/><br/>As is detailed by the course description, I believe it is true that you do not have to have prior exposure to the concepts. However, it is helpful to have had practice with proof&ndash;writing and familiarity with mathematical abstraction; from start to end, 55 involves heavy amounts of both. In choosing between 55 and a different intro course, the key factor seems be how much time one wants to spend on math versus other subjects, clubs, etc. I know several people who dropped and switched into 25 or some other class, and their quality of life instantly shot up. That being said, there are students who might have thrived in 55, but were driven away by various factors such as the reputation, rumors of and experiences with the culture, and the stress and the time commitment. Whatever your concerns, the class is definitely worth trying. Many can attest to how transformative the experience is.  (Details incoming…I hope the egregious length of this report is justified by my wanting to describe each dimension of the experience.)<br/><br/>55 can consume one’s life, but contrary to common perception, it does not have to. In any case, be prepared for this class to be one of your biggest priorities. And, to reiterate: hopefully, you are considering 55 not as part of some prestige game, but because you like math, or think you could. I don’t see much fun in spending atrocious amounts of time on this class if you don’t.<br/><br/>Despite its reputation, 55 has a strong community. Although there may be an adjustment period while students get to know each other, pset groups tend to form naturally within the first few weeks. 55ers are exceedingly bright, but they are also college kids who like to have fun, spend time with each other outside of psetting, and go out—maybe less than your average student, but still. It is both possible and common to make good friends in this class. (A perhaps reassuring sidenote: 55ers are not one&ndash;dimensionally interested in math. In my cohort, there are students who are quite humanities&ndash;oriented, and also students passionate about physics, the life sciences, philosophy—all sorts of stuff.)<br/><br/>A slight warning that although the vast majority of the students in 55 are very kind to each other and enthusiastic about the material, the so&ndash;called “math bro” is a real phenomenon. By which I mean, you may encounter people who sometimes carry themselves as though they are too good for the class, dismiss and judge their peers, do not take feedback to heart, and seem more interested in showing off than being a genuine classmate. No one I met consistently behaved in such ways, but these interactions occurred frequently enough to infiltrate the culture of the class, and substantially harmed several students’ experience. My advice is to be a little careful with who you engage with and to be prepared to defend your ideas. I feel it’s generally healthy to assume best intentions, even when someone is being unkind. Posturing in this class usually manifests from insecurity. Still, please don’t let anyone deter you from believing you are capable. <br/><br/>Many 55ers feel tasked with fending off impostor syndrome. Here’s one takeaway from learning alongside my classmates that helped me combat the feeling: there is no singular way to succeed in this class, and no prototypical picture of what a “good student” in 55 looks like. That’s in terms of study habits, who you work with and how you like to work, what background you came in with, and what your academic and vocational interests are. It hit me early on that students in this class are across&ndash;the&ndash;board brilliant and inspiring, but in different ways. “Belonging” in 55 takes many forms, and there isn&#x27;t some obscure intellectual standard that you need to measure up to. <br/><br/>Definitely bear in mind that 55 gets stressful. The pace can grow close to unforgiving, the psets can take ages to work through and write up, and the content can be quite difficult to properly understand. I recommend the usual advice of reviewing ASAP after lecture and trying to make sense of what you’re confused about as soon as you can, as well as starting the psets early, so that you are not regularly suffering through the start of your week. (It does not feel good to become personally acquainted with 11:55&ndash;ing a pset, but it seems universally difficult to avoid doing so.) Whatever expectations and judgments people place upon you, know that it&#x27;s normal to feel challenged, and completely okay for concepts to take time. In essence, the less you measure your classmates and the kinder you are to yourself, the better your experience will be.<br/><br/>In all aspects, there is no shortage of support in this class. The CAs are a wonderful group of students: on top of grading, passionate about the mathematics, reliable in their understanding of the material, and accommodating throughout. They are a great resource for basically any concern or question related to the course, and for getting a sense of what it might be like to do mathematics at Harvard beyond 55. Office hours offer a nice space to engage with a smaller group of classmates, solidify your understanding of the lecture material, and get specialized help with the homework. The CAs are happy to talk to you, and they truly want to help you learn. <br/><br/>Also, Prof. Auroux is absolutely phenomenal. He’s everything you could want in a professor: encouraging, brilliant, kind, patient, and evidently, deeply invested in the course and his students’ well&ndash;being. He knows the ins and outs of teaching this class—the breadth and depth of his understanding is unreal. Seriously, as far as a good number of 55ers are concerned, he’s one of the most incredible people to have ever graced the halls of the Science Center. <br/><br/>His lectures are, without exception, excellent: well&ndash;organized, packed with exciting ideas, communicated with a healthy dose of humor (he does not miss; the math department should take notes), compelling to the point that people get FOMO at the thought of not going (my motivation for morning lectures this semester was born and will die with his class). Often, he explains or motivates a concept so clearly and eloquently that I have to write his description down verbatim. I can&#x27;t count the number of times some topic wasn&#x27;t quite clicking for me, but once I got the Auroux treatment of it during lecture, it just started making sense. It’s not unusual for the topic of the day to leave people reeling with “what the ****, that was amazing” and losing their minds. The upshot: go to lecture!<br/><br/>Sometimes measurable by hours of sleep lost to this class, Prof. Auroux cares an absurd amount about his students. He actively checks around both after lecture and during office hours to make sure he&#x27;s answered every question, and he makes an effort to hold office hours even when he’s horrifically busy, jet&ndash;lagged, etc. He stays available for 55 at basically all (reasonable) times of day, even over weekends. You really have to give this class your best effort to match his dedication. Prof Auroux is just such an inspiring, wholesome presence, and I can’t adequately describe how special an experience he makes the class. Please do take 55 with him if you get the chance. Between him and the CAs, you will be in very good hands.</td>

It is a lot of work crammed in to one semester, but don&#x27;t worry about moving so fast that you don&#x27;t absorb the information, you will build a strong foundation in group theory and linear algebra. The psets are long and hard, and sometimes lecture can be fast paced and not too interesting, but still a great class to take.

The community is pretty good, but despite what people say, the problem sets are very much doable on your own as well if you work hard on them. Denis Auroux is a good lecturer and explains things well, and he makes a lot of time for his students. If you have a lot of higher math experience coming into this class, you might find lectures easier, but the problem sets will still be difficult.</td>

			<td class="TabularBody_LeftColumn" headers="comment-2_e53e2c9d-bf32-4403-baa7-6fddd95ac1d3">Math 55a is a strong introductory course proceeding at twice the pace of other undergraduate courses. It covers an extensive list of topics that sets its students up well for future classes in many areas of mathematics. <br/><br/>Topics start from a typical introductory course in group theory and linear algebra to the theory of bilinear forms, group representations&#x2F;characters, and the tools used in finite group classification (e.g. semidirect products) that lie beyond the introductory level and lie as good precursors to their relevant fields.<br/><br/>In terms of time commitment, expect math 55a to be your main class, especially if you have not taken both an introductory group theory and linear algebra class in the past. Even having learned both, you will have strong crutches to rely on but will still be pushed past your comfort zone by challenging (but excellent) problem sets. If you have learned only one of the two, math 55a will likely take 16&ndash;25 hours a week, and if you have learned neither, this class may take more than 30 hours a week.<br/><br/>With both and a strong problem&ndash;solving background, I’d guess that you can finish all of the weekly work in 10 hours. Your problem set group matters a lot, as your pace will be tied to that of your peers if you are cooperating &ndash; this dynamic is an important piece of the math 55a experience. This class is inherently a social experience, and one that is critical to building a strong base for the year.<br/><br/>It is possible, with extensive experience, to take this course plus another class of similar calibre: such as physics 16, hum 10, or a graduate course. Depending in the background, this can genuinely be reasonable. However, if this is done, you cannot add anything else on top: the remaining classes must be low&ndash;commitment, like expos or a first year seminar, or you may pay the price.<br/><br/>For math students thinking about skipping this, I would suggest that the college major isn’t a race: deep acceleration in courses is worth far less, and having a strong background is paramount. You may underestimate the importance of motivation in your success, and crushing that motivation by going headfirst into classes you can’t handle is not the greatest way to start. This is a rewarding a memorable class &ndash; I’d suggest that if you are willing to handle workload, the people you meet may be well worth it. <br/><br/>Finally, a brief note on problem set groups. Math 55a students very quickly coalesce into problem set groups who work together on problems sets each week. Since collaboration is encouraged, this is natural, and it’s simply easier to stick with the same people. The pace of the group is extremely important, as all students in the group will have to proceed at said pace.<br/><br/>When the pace is too fast (e.g. someone experienced is solving problems quickly), the rest of the group (especially less experienced students) will be forcibly dragged along, digesting words and logic instead of gaining real hands on experience in problem solving. They will improve their comprehension, but this ultimately is harmful for their learning.<br/><br/>When the pace is too slow, the group won’t be able to finish problem sets in time, which is dangerous: the price will be paid in sleep and in morale. The commitment and price paid can grow to mindblowing numbers, with up to 40&ndash;50 hours spent a week being possible.<br/><br/>Because of this dynamic, the size of the group should be limited and the pace of its students should be similar to make it a comforting experience. The class will be difficult and people with learn at different paces, so respect, patience, and support are essentials. Students with experience in the material should consider taking a step back to allow others to truly contribute, so as to not rob them of the experience. However, they must also lend a hand in tough spots to help the group along.<br/><br/>For all students, your CAs are strong assets on the problem sets and in conceptual learning in general. I highly suggest seeing them if a problem has been taking a while, and a hint from them and help both you and your problem set group along.<br/><br/>Overall, a really fun class! I loved the people and the learning, and this class met my expectations. Would take again. The grading is extremely fast (which should not be taken for granted) thanks to the dedication of professor Auroux and the TA. Lectures are well taught and the lecture notes are exceptional.</td>

The concepts taught are still introductory for the most part, it&#x27;s just a lot of stuff to learn, and the concepts are sometimes very abstract and hard to grasp.
