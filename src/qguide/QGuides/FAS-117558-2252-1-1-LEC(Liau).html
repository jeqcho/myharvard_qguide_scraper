But once you get to Chem 27, you feel accustomed to the material and you have a better intuition for all the mechanisms&#x2F;questions. This course was also taught very well. I would just be aware that it is a heavy time commitment for a class and they can be pretty harsh with grading some questions on exams.</td>

I would say to do every practice problem you can get your hands on, and don&#x27;t get too stressed if you see a mechanism that you&#x27;ve never seen before on an exam. You can figure it out, and if you don&#x27;t, chances are a lot of other people in the class can&#x27;t either, and you&#x27;ll get points back (lmao).</td>

Before the practice exams are released you cn review annotated lecture notes and section notes. You can also use this time to make flashcards (Quilt or Anki) on conceptual concepts from lecture and practice the mechanism with pen&#x2F;pencil and paper.  Complete one practice exam while simulating real exam conditions (timing&#x2F;quiet) ASAP then review it in help room&#x2F;with an ARC tutor. Reviewing with the key alone may not allow you to catch errors in your approach&#x2F;how you think about organic chemistry. Afterwards, complete practice problems (pollev questions from lecture, section practice problems, and PSET problems) based on material you missed on the exam (this helps save time). Review these in help room or one on one with a course staff member&#x2F;ARC tutor if you have time. Otherwise, make sure you fully understand the answer key&#x2F;how to avoid repeating your mistakes. Then you can take the second practice exam while simulating real exam conditions (timing&#x2F;quiet). If you still have time left redo previously missed questions. For this class you must use every resource available to you to succeed. While you may not guarantee yourself a perfect score you&#x27;ll have the confidence to finish each exam on time. Don&#x27;t be embarrassed if you struggle &ndash;&ndash; especially in the beginning. Reach out for help when you need it.</td>

Your alternative is Chem 20&#x2F;30, but you probably have already gone through 17. Course structure is solid and basically the same as Chem 17, with better labs and a much larger emphasis on the biology&ndash;related aspect of organic chemistry. Huge emphasis on mechanisms introduced at the end of Chem 17 (aldol&#x2F;retro&ndash;aldol, Claisen, etc.), which I honestly is not easy at all but cool once you do them enough. Make sure you study well for your exams and do relatively well on your psets (the &gt;75 = 100 is still a lifesaver) :D</td>

The course staff seems more invested in enforcing rigid, unrealistic standards to gatekeep medical school than in actually educating students. <br/><br/>Corrections to problem sets, worksheets, and practice exams are frequently posted less than 24 hours before an exam, as if that’s remotely acceptable. It’s not just sloppy, it’s negligent. How do you put out course materials riddled with typos and conceptual errors that can mislead students? The only reasonable answer is utter incompetence or complete disregard for the impact on student learning. And yet, we’re expected to treat these flawed materials as our basis for learning while somehow being penalized for smaller mistakes than the ones they make.<br/><br/>The grading on exams is also unnecessarily harsh. The rubrics are engineered to punish: you can lose several points for the smallest deviations from the answer key, even when your reasoning is sound. It often feels like the graders are actively looking for ways to deduct points, and probably, if you handed them a solution straight from the official key, they’d probably still find something to mark wrong. The exams, unsurprisingly, are disproportionately difficult compared to the problem sets and worksheets, with an expectation of conceptual precision that is never emphasized during regular coursework.<br/><br/>What’s truly unfortunate is that the material itself has the potential to be engaging , it&#x27;s certainly more interesting than Chem 17. I genuinely came into the course excited to learn. But that enthusiasm was swiftly erased by the course staff. <br/><br/>This class isn’t difficult, it’s dispiriting. And the worst part is that it doesn’t have to be. But as it stands, it feels less like a learning experience and more like a weed&ndash;out course.</td>

Over a dozen modifications to PSETs, practice questions, and practice tests were released throughout the semester. Some of these edits were minor, such as flawed arrows and&#x2F;or PTs in mechanisms, whereas other were more signifcant (i.e unlabeled key residues in pymol images, confusing phrasing in questions, etc.) In multiple occasions I had questions in exams where despite writing the correct answer almost verbatim from the answer key they were marked completely wrong. I&#x27;m glad the course provides failsafes for this with the re&ndash;grade requests, but that doesn&#x27;t mean this isn&#x27;t unprofessional. You&#x27;d expect that for a course that publishes content with so many little errors they&#x27;d be more lenient with grading for students that also commit similar little errors, but this isn&#x27;t the case. It is completely incoherent to penalize students for doing errors as trivial as omitting formal charges in a mechanism with complex structures and with over ten steps, when the course instructors themselves do these errors regularly. For this I suggest two potential solutions: 1) reduce the content covered by this class so more time is devoted to make sure everything that&#x27;s published is actually correct, or 2) be reasonable with the way this course penalizes trivial errors (aka. the sensible solution). No I do not think doing minor deductions such as 0.5pt or 1.0pt deductions makes this current penalization scheme reasonable, because let&#x27;s be real, in a given chem27 exam you&#x27;re doing so many mechanisms in such a short amount of time that these mistakes add up. The difference between an 80s and a 90s in a CHEM27 exam boils down to time management and attention to minute details that don&#x27;t have a signifcant impact on most mechanisms&ndash; this is what should be expected for a standardized test like the SAT, not an introductory organic chemistry course. If the course instructors want to artifically deflate grades so bad then just curve the class at their discretion instead of pretending the class isn&#x27;t curved and everyone can achieve an A&#x2F;A&ndash;. You are actively competing against other people for good grades&ndash; if this weren&#x27;t the case they wouldn&#x27;t change the difficulty of exams based on how well people did on the previous one.<br/><br/>PROs:<br/>If you&#x27;re into chemical biology, the content covered by this course is genuinely fascinating. I personally do not think CHEM27 should reduce the volume of its content. It&#x27;s an overwhelming amount of information to absorb in one semester but it is definitely doable even with limited organic chemistry experience if you lock&ndash;in and commit to this class. I liked the lectures, even if because of the amount of content covered they ultimately failed to address the nuances of the more complicated type of mechanism questions found in exams.<br/><br/>tldr; some courses are meant to be weeder courses. chem27 is one of those. if you have to take it, just lock&ndash;in for the midterms, do every single practice problem at your disposal. the content is great but goddamn the way they grade and release flawed psets&#x2F;practice materials makes my blood boil like no other course has before.</td>

Lectures can be somewhat dull and monotonous, but there&#x27;s only so much you can do to spice up the content when taught to a lecture hall of several hundred people, so that not a big issue. My bigger problem came with the way assignments were constantly graded like they were desperate to penalize you for every minor detail. It was not uncommon for me to lose tens of points without a single conceptual error, and there&#x27;s no curve to balance this out with the typos from other people. Meanwhile the rubrics are pedantic at best and impossible to understand at worst, making it a challenge to even work out what you did wrong. I frequently found it difficult to look at my graded assignments because of how angry the rubrics made me. I wish I had taken the 20&#x2F;30 series because I want to actually feel engaged by the content and to struggle because it is hard, not because the course is doing its level best to make you never want to take organic chemistry again. Ultimately, if you have to take this because you&#x27;re premed, the content is not that hard, especially if you did well in 17. However, it will make you hate organic chemistry, which sucks because the topic is really fun.</td>

There&#x27;s a lot of practice material (module problems, practice exams, etc.). I recommend doing and redoing these practice problems and going over lecture slides over and over. I did this for every exam, and I still didn&#x27;t do great. Overall, this class went a lot better for me than Chem 17, even though Chem 17 was objectively easier in terms of content and more reasonable exams. However, Chem 17 was incredibly challenging for me and didn&#x27;t go great. This discouraged me a bit to begin this semester, but I worked really hard and it somewhat paid off. That doesn&#x27;t mean I did great. Even though I felt confident about every topic, I somehow still got stuck on a question every exam. The midterms were really challenging, like unreasonably challenging. Many people ran out of time. There was always a problem or two that was just so difficult that people spent half of the time trying to solve and ended up losing points on other parts too because they ran out of time&#x2F;couldn&#x27;t double check their answers. The graders are SO picky.  They&#x27;re so strict and it doesn&#x27;t even make sense because for EVERY single practice exam (and a few psets), they sent an announcement  with corrections. Like, if you make mistakes on these practice exam keys and don&#x27;t realize till a few hours&#x2F;days later, how would you expect students not to make the same silly mistakes when they only have 80 mins for these complex and difficult problems? THAT is the most frustrating part of the course. Some of the concepts are just so abstract that they don&#x27;t make any sense and even the course staff cannot explain, yet we are still expected to explain them somehow. I guess that&#x27;s a part of the learning process, but I do feel like they had some pretty unreasonable and unrealistic expectations from students. That being said, most of the undergrad TFs are GREAT. Most CAs are also pretty good, but this course was taught a bit differently last year, so there are a few difficult concepts that some of the CAs can&#x27;t explain too well. Anyways, if you take Chem 27, it is probably because you&#x27;re pre&ndash;med. It is an incredibly challenging course, but you will survive. Do NOT let this course crush your dreams. You will get through it. Expect to put in over 10 hours a week of work. It&#x27;s really difficult to get an A in this class, but I think an A&ndash; or B+ isn&#x27;t too out of reach. Chem 17&#x2F;27 really humbled me. But, I promise, everyone else (or most people) is also struggling with this class. Go to help room, TF office hours, do all the module problems then redo them, redo psets, take the practice exams, review lecture slides, review TF notes if your TF has those. You got this!</td>

PSETs and section packets are written well like CHEM 17, but the exams are more poorly written than CHEM 17. the exam free&ndash;response questions often feature details that can be hard to assemble into how the answer keys want you to respond. for example, many of the inhibitor questions want a very specific feature of a drug that makes it successful when often a few distinct features work together. this problem, along with some annoying changes in their &quot;chem 27 abbreviation&quot; allowances, frequently made studying quite irritating. sometimes you spend more time remembering how they want you to abbreviate different mechanisms and not focusing on how the mechanisms actually proceed.</td>

For example, before Exam #2, over four answer keys were altered the night prior. This causes confusion, undermines preparation, and reflects poor course organization.<br/><br/>Unclear expectations and unfair grading — The exams require rubric items that were never previously communicated or required. Students are penalized for missing minor details (like stating the co&ndash;product instead of drawing it out), even when the course has admitted the question was unclear or inconsistent with prior problem sets. Despite acknowledging these issues, the course team refuses to award points.<br/><br/>Unprofessional behavior by TFs and grading subjectivity — Teaching fellows have openly admitted to not granting regrade requests because they “don’t feel like reading” or “don’t want to give points to someone just because they want a good grade.” Grading is highly subjective, and some TFs even joke about withholding points arbitrarily. Every single exam, I have lost double points due to be docked off for the same msitake more than once.<br/><br/>Additionally, the problem sets and module questions are significantly easier than the exams, creating a false sense of preparedness. Students who complete problem sets honestly are disadvantaged, especially since they only count for 10% of the grade. Many students admit to copying problem sets entirely. Similarly, the lab component is minimal in weight, further reducing opportunities for students to recover from exam&ndash;related grading issues.<br/><br/>When students bring concerns to staff, they often acknowledge the problems but offer no action—sometimes even suggesting students withdraw instead. This response is unacceptable.<br/><br/>It is extremely frustrating to study diligently, understand the material thoroughly, and still lose points due to ambiguous expectations or sudden rubric changes—especially when friends at other universities succeed using our same notes and explanations.<br/><br/>This course&#x27;s structure and handling of student concerns have been deeply unfair, and I’m relieved it’s over. I hope serious changes are made so future students don’t have to go through this experience.</td>

If going between 27 or 30, it comes down to preferences of mechanism vs synthesis.  Sirinya as the course instructor is amazing!! Do the homeworks, the modules, and practice the mechanisms a lot! Having done chem17 is very helpful for basics and you will use them in 27. Yes it&#x27;s orgo but the lecture notes are pretty well organized and the problems are very relevant and build that awareness in mechanism identification.  Use your molecular model kit it&#x27;s actually an asset during exams. Praises to the TFs and CAs especially who are holding us up, especially during office hours!</td>

Brian and Sirinya are absolutely amazing at breaking complex concepts into digestible chunks, and as the course goes on everything (from 17 and 27) kind of pieces together  to form a really satisfying picture. They make seemingly intimidating topics, like glycolysis and TCA, into a combo of fundamental concepts; other topics, like PLP, TPP, and proteases, are just really cool to think about. Definitely take time to master the content throughout the semester, because there is quite a lot! Having a strong understanding of chem17 is really really helpful. Sometimes the missed points on PSETS and exams feel a bit nitty gritty&#x2F;arbitrary, but you just gotta play the game a little.</td>

Cramming before exams is tough for this class, and exams are worth a lot of your grade. Pay attention in lecture+section, go to the exam reviews, and do all of the practice problems provided to you. If you are struggling on a topic, seek support.  Courseload is fair: 1 problem set per week and lab 4x the entire semester. You will be fine.</td>

The Krebs cycle unit stuff is difficult, but everything else is 100% doable if you put in the work. Do all of the practice problems to prep for tests (including PSETs etc), and you will be good.

It is much more conceptual, but at the same time, the mechanisms are much more complex and longer. You really need to know how to do things in this class AND know why you are doing it. Unlike in Chem17, you cannot really rely on just knowing mechanisms anymore. Go to office hours for PSETS and reviewing for exams. In addition, make sure you are using all the practice problems and exams at your disposal, it will truly help you find patterns in the types of questions asked. Make sure at least one exam is taken timed so you know what to expect. Lastly, work with friends, I cannot recommend it more. Going through this class alone can definitely be a challenge.</td>

I liked that this class tied a lot of mechanisms with the biochemistry where they applied and contextualized it in a very informative matter without us necessarily needing to memorize a lot of biological details. The concepts honestly just boil down to a few patterns&#x2F;mechanisms that become more clear as the course progresses, but there is a lot to remember. As long as you practice (module practice problems are amazing!), you can pick mechanisms up and better understand them (even in very short periods of time right before exams). I made notesheets summarizing module note overviews (super helpful!) and copied down mechanisms under I remembered them. As long as you can understand the rationale behind mechanisms, they are easier to remember. However, mechanisms on exams can often be quite unexpected and it feels like you just have to get lucky....The most frustrating thing about this course probably had to do with explanation questions &ndash;&ndash; it always felt like they wanted to hear very specific things and it always felt like you were losing points for very nitpicky or minute details, even though you had demonstrated an understanding of the concepts. It was honestly pretty impossible to get points back in those cases.</td>

Midterm 1 was fair, but midterms 2 and 3 were awful. It reflects quite poorly on the course and the instructors when the exams have extremely low averages, and students are dealing with severe mental and physical health issues as a result of this course. This year, they had to curve midterm 2 by five points, which they haven&#x27;t done historically. Setting up students for failure and screwing them over isn&#x27;t something that I expected from a course at Harvard, especially a course that is already supposed to be so rigorous and is a requirement for premeds to take.

The course picks up substantially after that (midterms 2 and 3 will be quite difficult, and require lots of memorization and time spent studying&#x2F;drilling mechanisms). You need to start really focusing around Lecture 11. Also, in this course, you must be insanely precise (way more than you think), and even then, you will lose points because their goal is to nitpick and find errors in your work, even if you understand everything at (a) a big picture level (b) a practical level and (c) are already precise. <br/><br/>The grading on exams is quite appalling. First, it is a significant discrepancy between how Chem 20 and Chem 30 are graded (not saying this class should be graded the same as those, because they are way more rigorous and way better classes overall, but perhaps this course staff could learn something from real organic chemists). They take off points for things that have nothing to do with your understanding of the material. You can understand 100% of the content at a super fine grain level, and will still miss 5&ndash;10 points because you protonate a carbonyl from a double bond instead of pushing the electrons up to the oxygen and then protonating. That took several points off my last midterm — I did not miss anything else on that exam. I was a top performer in the class and got a B+. The practice problem keys, and the keys for the practice exams themselves contain errors that would result in the key only scoring around a 93 on the midterms and final. I am not kidding. Why do you have to send out updated practice keys the day before exams when the course has been running for years? Also, when a key contains errors that if a student made, you would take off points for on the exams, what does that say about the way the course is graded?</td>

A few things to remember: a) submit regrade requests if something was graded incorrectly, as the course staff are good about correcting those mistakes and will often give you the points back and b) complete ALL of the practice materials before the test.

I also found it super cool to see the connections to biological systems. The exams are fair, though they will put some twists on the questions to really test that you know the concepts behind the problem solving (and not just how to regurgitate mechanisms). My biggest tip is to really spend time on the material&ndash; it might feel uncomfortable and unfamiliar at first, but you just have to practice it over and over again until it becomes clear.  If you&#x27;re ever confused, take advantage of helproom and ask the CAs and TFs&ndash; they&#x27;re all super knowledgeable and friendly! Coaching, if they offer it again, is also super helpful to keep yourself accountable, have more focused attention from a CA and also get tips from someone who has taken the course before.</td>

Two moments that involve the number 2 that sum up the Chem two&ndash;seven course material experience: Midterm 3 Review being mistitled as the Midterm 2 Review + 2 instances of corrections to the final exam during the final exam.  I once heard someone say that once the corrections to the late&ndash;released practice final exams dropped, it marked the moment that every practice midterm&#x2F;exam released in Chem 27 had subsequent corrections released later on.  I am not checking to verify this fact because empirically I feel that it is true.  I will now write an actual Qreport.<br/><br/>So I&#x27;m coming out of Chem 27 really liking organic chemistry.  The mechanisms are super fun to think about, and it&#x27;s not often that doing a pset is really just about solving little puzzles with specific electron&ndash;pushing rules.  The first time I saw the synthesis of a steroid I literally thought about changing my concentration to chemistry (because the mechanism was cool, not because I&#x27;m addicted to steroids).  Brian and Sirinya lead great lectures, I had a wonderful section, and Raymond saved my entire semester with the Benchling revamp to lab.  The course materials, however, make the class much more painful than it needs to be.  Corrections and late releases on psets and practice exams were more frequent in Chem 27 than in my other classes combined, and I know people have gotten frustrated by this given that grading is generally quite stringent (although there still is the generous pset grading policy).  If this issue is corrected, this class is golden.  If not, your organic chemistry experience will have an arbitrary added difficulty where you wonder if you&#x27;re missing part of the question or if the question is missing part of the question.  Regardless, organic chemistry rocks.</td>

If you&#x27;re looking for a pure biochem course, I&#x27;d consider some other options. If you&#x27;re premed, you probably have to take this course anyways.<br/><br/>Starting with the positives of this course, I adored the course content! It&#x27;s basically everything I could ask for in a course—learning about how biological processes work fundamentally was really neat. On top of that, Sirinya and Brian are excellent lecturers (though, at times, not super engaging). Lab was surprisingly fun, and I have only good things to say about the lab teaching staff. In addition, there are an abundance of practice problems between practice exams, psets, and section handouts, so you&#x27;ll always have something to use for studying.<br/><br/>With that said, these materials don&#x27;t cover everything you need to know for the exams—ideally, you can wing it on exams based on what you&#x27;ve practiced. In addition, the teaching staff, especially when compared to Chem 17, is surprisingly inadequate. The TFs, while all very knowledgeable, have varying success at teaching—speaking from my experience with an amazing Chem 17 TF, a satisfactory 27 TF, and two very lackluster substitute 27 TFs. The CAs are also not great; while some know their stuff (and should become TFs!), there have been many times when a CA could not explain an answer in the key or would have to be corrected. Sirinya, Brian, and Emma, while all nice people willing to help, can feel somewhat unapproachable at times.<br/><br/>I enjoyed Chem 27, but I think it was much harder than Chem 17 (despite coming into 27 w&#x2F; 17 knowledge vs. coming into 17 w&#x2F; only gen chem).

You’re going to have to apply mechanisms that combine sometimes 5+ ideas from Chem 17 to novel situations in this course. There is so much content to remember and memorize, but also so much application and critical thinking involved in this course, which is what I think makes it difficult. However, Brian and Sirinya are AWESOME lecturers and will answer any questions you have in their instructor office hours very nicely. They are also wonderful people to talk to. <br/><br/>Now, the qualms I have with the class. Grading is really inconsistent (especially lab and psets and somehow lecture, where 90% is seen as less than 80%). Sometimes Tfs in office hours would tell me I had the right idea for a Pset question, and my line of thinking turned out to be completely wrong! I don’t think this is acceptable, and this needs to change. Also, on the explanation questions in psets or exams, it feels like they want to take points off if its not word for word with the answer key, which I think is a narrow&ndash;minded approach to grading those questions.<br/><br/>Yes, the exams are difficult, especially 2 and 3.  They will require you to solve things that you didn’t see before. Whether that’s good or not, to each their own. I think they made the final a bit lighter than last year for that reason.<br/><br/>Anyway, if you have to take it, stay on top of remembering content and do as many practice problems as possible to keep applying knowledge and figure out patterns. By doing so, you are set for doing well on exams. Good luck!</td>

Chem 20 felt like I was broadening my knowledge of chemistry and unlocking new abilities for each type of molecule and reaction we discussed; even though it was challenging, it was so rewarding that I didn&#x27;t mind. Chem 27 is the opposite. You don&#x27;t really learn any new *chemistry*, just the same acyl transfer reactions and Sn2s over and over, but the course is so hard on you for making tiny mistakes or not phrasing things the way they want it that the material feels more challenging and more stressful than it really should. The CAs&#x2F;TFs don&#x27;t really have a good knowledge of chemistry beyond what&#x27;s in the class, so they&#x27;re not able to tell you why certain reactions are favorable. This also has the effect of making it so that if you phrase your answers slightly differently than the rubric, even if your answer is physically or scientifically valid, they will take points off, turn around, and insist you&#x27;re the one that&#x27;s wrong. I spent most of my effort in the class memorizing the types of explanations they wanted for their answers; the fewer craps I gave about the chemistry, the better I did on the exams. I ended up doing well despite the odds, but it was so infuriating the entire time.<br/><br/>If you&#x27;re considering the difference between Chem 17&#x2F;27 and Chem 20&#x2F;30 as a premed, do NOT take 17&#x2F;27 if you can avoid it. Take 20&#x2F;30 and MCB 65 for the biochem requirement. The more advanced your scientific background is, the more you will hate this class. Just my two cents.</td>

			<td class="TabularBody_LeftColumn" headers="comment-2_57a406d1-6e9e-421a-8649-b068597ff1ba">Is this class harder than Chem 17? For many people, yes. Will this course take over your life around every midterm and final? Absolutely. Does that mean you can&#x27;t do well in this course? No!!! The teaching staff is super supportive, and they really want you to do well. They care about your progress in this class, and they will dedicate time to help you reach your goals. You can also rely on your classmates, who are (almost always) willing to lend a hand. Chem 27 is a team sport, so you&#x27;re not alone in this at all. It is going to be hard (like depressingly hard sometimes), but that doesn&#x27;t mean you can&#x27;t rock it!</td>
