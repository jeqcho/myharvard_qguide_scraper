There are too many moving pieces and it just feels so overwhelming all the time. I decided after the midterm to take the class P&#x2F;F as it was just stressful to keep up with all the deliverables. Having quizzes&#x2F;exercises due almost every class, problem sets, a final project, and 2 midterms is a lot to manage on top of a rigorous courseload. I do think this is a very useful class but feel like it is way too intensive to actually get much out of it. You simply do not have the time to learn the material in full and complete every single thing that needs to be turned in.</td>

Quizzes after every lecture, 6 PSets, 2 exams (with in&ndash;class and take&ndash;home portion), and a final project. PSets are biweekly and can be done with a partner (one submission for the both of you), but the course has made all assignments harder, probably because of ChatGPT use, so don&#x27;t underestimate how long that will take you. Exams are fair. Final project is kind of tough, especially because it is due around the same time as the last exam. Take this class with people you know because there is so much partner work. It is also the most useful class you can probably take if you are interested in Data Science. Really applied material that you can use right away in coding and work.</td>

Great course organization through Ed, but it can be easy to get lost in all the different things to keep track of (Ed pre&ndash;class quiz, post&ndash;class quiz, psets, milestones, project, midterms, slides, textbook, labs, Canvas groups, etc). Exams are fair. Psets can be graded on weird and specific requirements (i.e. having a specific comment about one part of a long Jupyter notebook). Would recommend for anyone looking for an introduction to the field.</td>

Even if lecture content can sometimes get advancd, PSETS are quite simple and plus you can do them in pairs. The exams are open book and also open internet so they are pretty easy too. You also end the class with a completed project. Overall, there is not too much reason not to take this class.

I would often find myself deep in a different pset, and forget that I need to answer frivolous multiple choice questions midway through the week for 10 percent of my grade. I would keep the lecture checks but make it once a week instead of 2 times a week and put the assignment on canvas (where all the grades are).  The final project was split into 5 different milestones with the most inconvenient deadlines &ndash;&ndash; 2&#x2F;3 milestones probably could have sufficed for a project of this scale.

On the other, you have problem sets that don&#x27;t test you on lecture material (rather, they rely on quite a lot of copy and pasting), midterms that encompass things beyond the problem sets and lectures (they rely on quite a lot of Googling), and labs where you are talked at about blocks of code for an hour every week&ndash;&ndash;things that are not necessarily bad, but make you go, &quot;huh.&quot; Overall, I would take it, but be prepared for a lot of quirks, unless the course staff irons them out before next year.</td>

It&#x27;s also a very practical CS class and you do learn quite a bit job&ndash;skills wise if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re going for.<br/><br/>That is where my compliments end. This course was disorganized from start to finish. The course is largely on Ed, but some assignments and grades are on Canvas, and some important information is on Ed discussion. You can tell how confusing this gets when there are 3 different sources of info, which is why many students just did not know a lot of info logistics&ndash;wise. <br/><br/>This course either needs more TFs or it needs better TFs. There were multiple project groups that needed to contact their TF yet couldn&#x27;t reach them.  During our final project presentation review, the TF, who is supposed tell us how to make our presentation better (which is a huge % of our grade),  was on their phone the whole time and told us &quot;you guys did a great job&quot; as the only criticism despite us going 8 minutes over the time limit.<br/><br/>There is also very limited feedback on the projects and the homework depending on which TF you have assigned, which makes it very hard to know whether you&#x27;re on track or not in the course.<br/><br/>My final note to the faculty for this course is that if you are worried enough about cheating and ChatGPT that you openly chastise your class for 10 minutes during lecture using various scare&ndash;tactics, then you should not create a testing environment that makes it easy for students to cheat (i.e do not let the coding part be take&ndash;home.) Regardless, I still heard about many instances of students openly cheating during the quiz part of the midterms which is disheartening. <br/><br/>There can easily be a situation in this class where student A barely attended lectures, cheated on the midterms&#x2F;assignments, and was still able to attain an A due to lax TF&ndash;ing, while student B ends up with an A&ndash; because they tried to do this class the right way yet got a harsher TF, inadequate feedback, and underperformed on midterms due to an inflated curve.</td>

It&#x27;s not that the PSets or the class is particularly hard, but that it&#x27;s time&ndash;consuming that makes it a course that will probably test you more than you think. Busywork is the name of the game in CS109a. The final project, too, should not be taken lightly as if you procrastinate or miss a milestone you&#x27;ll be in dire straits. The same is true for the quizzes. Diligence pays dividends later on in the course, and I&#x27;d really recommend trying to go to class as much as you can muster because it&#x27;ll make your life easier come the exams.

I don&#x27;t know if there is not enough teaching staff hired, but I feel many things could be improved. First, this class takes way too long to return assignments. I have currently taken the exam and not have my HW5 and my HW6 grades returned to me which is unfortunate because the take home coding portion of the exam was very similar to one of these homeworks. I feel a larger staff could help grade faster an ease the burden of a teaching team that now has to grade 2 HWs, 2 parts of an exam, and a final project. <br/><br/>Additionally, I feel like the structure of the final project is not executed well and makes the second half of the course feel drastically heavier than the first half of the course. The milestones they lay out for you to complete are kind of unclear and overlap a lot. So, my group was left wondering what we have completed and what we haven&#x27;t completed. I get the staff&#x27;s point of not wanting us to wait until the last minute to start, but its hard to have a clear vision for the project when we haven&#x27;t learned all of the needed information yet. Also, I would go back to the staff giving out project ideas and datasets because my team ended up working with an extremely complex dataset that ruined the project experience. Furthermore, the HWs themselves were pretty typical for a CS class, but adding hours of work a week for a final project made the time crunch tough. <br/><br/>Also, I think Friday lab being a lecture is not a great structure.

The main thing you get out of this class is an uncanny familiarity with working with Python&#x27;s scikit&ndash;learn library; what you will not get out of this class is a deep understanding of the theory behind any of the methods discussed in the class, which, again, could be good or bad. <br/><br/>Pavlos is a hilarious, kind, and fun lecturer and his lectures are always great to go to. Natesh&#x27;s were OK too. Labs are totally useless and not worth going to at all, they&#x27;re just a matter of clicking through cells. The midterm and final were fairly straightforward, and were open internet, which relieved a lot of the stress. Problem sets are tedious and time&ndash;consuming but not that difficult provided you start early.</td>

You have one homework every 2 weeks. You have 2 exams, the midterm and final, and one part is multiple choice (where they evaluate the entire theoretical part of the class) and the other part is a 3&ndash;hour code (where they assess the labs and the coding part). You also have a final group project. During the semester the class is chill since you have two weeks to do the homework and you can do it in pairs, but at the end of the semester it becomes super heavy since in two weeks you have to do the last homework that takes approximately 12 hours, you have the final exam (multiple choice and coding), you have to present milestone 5 and the final video (group project).</td>

I wanted to enjoy this class, and certainly some parts were very educational and valuable, but the sheer amount of work involved in the homework assignments, as well as the exhausting amount of things to juggle and keep track of (group project, quizzes, exams) makes it hard to recommend this class. It&#x27;s a shame, because Pavlos and Nitesh and very skilled professors, and I do believe that I learned a lot. But a few things about the class really bothered me:<br/>&ndash; a number of students were caught &quot;collaborating&quot; in the coding portion of the midterm, and so the course staff decided to change the syllabus to reduce the weight of the coding portion in our final grade. I view the syllabus as a contract between course staff and students and to change it because students broke the honor code &ndash;&ndash; rather than fail those students &ndash;&ndash; is irritating<br/>&ndash; the exams include a number of &quot;gotcha&quot; questions that are simply unconnected (or are only superficially connected) to course material. This is ostensibly to control the exam grade distributions, but it&#x27;s frustrating. The exams seemed impossible to prepare for.<br/>&ndash; the homework assignments are graded pedantically. You really need to go over your homework assignments closely before submitting to ensure that everything in every graph is properly labeled, the labels are perfectly aligned, etc. The homework instructions can also be vague and difficult to interpret, but graders seem to simply compare submitted homework to the rubric, which means there is no subjectivity in how they assess them.<br/>&ndash; the group project felt wholly unnecessary given the amount of work required with the homework. Group project milestones are due throughout the latter half of the semester and coincide with eg., Thanksgiving break, finals, etc. <br/><br/>In short, you will ALWAYS be working on at least one assignment for this class. And you can&#x27;t really re&ndash;calibrate with your homework strategy because the grades are released so slowly &ndash;&ndash; it&#x27;s currently nearly 1 week after the final and I still don&#x27;t have grades for the last 2 (out of 6 total) homework assignments. So if you&#x27;re doing something incorrectly in homework, you might not know until the course is over.<br/><br/>While I did learn a great deal in this course, so much of the work seems superfluous that I&#x27;m having a very difficult time in deciding whether I&#x27;ll register for the second class in the sequence.</td>

If you want to learn the practical, non&ndash;mathematical applications of these concepts it could be useful to take the course, but if you have limited space for cool classes and already generally know the content, I wouldn&#x27;t suggest it.

So take my experience with a grain of salt since I had done a lot of this before.<br/><br/>This course had a very interesting way of encouraging attendance. For each lecture&#x2F;lab you attend you get a Pavlos Coin™, 8 of which can be redeemed for a late day! More points awarded when you answer a question that Pavlos asked, though these weren&#x27;t that common. Beyond that, the course is very generous. 1&#x2F;3 of quizzes are dropped. execises only count if they would improve your grade. Beware, this laxness comes at a psychological cost! This class will take lower priority among your classes in any time crunch you have because they have set up the class in that way (surely deliberate on their part).<br/><br/>Pavlos&#x27; lectures were very engaging and he is generally a very fun person to be around (Please understand that even though I will refer to the professors with their first name, it is because I am avoiding having to say Professor xx all the time. I respect them a lot). He is certainly the good cop to Natesh&#x27; bad cop in class. He will, for example, start the class at 9 but he will perform a recap for the first couple minutes because he wants people to be able to come in without missing anything. Very nice of him. He certainly doesn&#x27;t mind students not showing up (they made the attendance optional after all). In contrast, even though Natesh is brilliant, he put me off in certain occasions. For example, there was one rare day when I had made the trek from the Quad for the 9AM class to the SC and what Natesh tells the class as one of his first sentences is something like &quot;So, we have been able to wake up for the class after all&quot; (not targeting anyone in particular but still). This was very unnecessary and uncalled for since we were the people IN the class. Certainly if he wants to blame anyone, shouldn&#x27;t he be showing disapproval to the students who didn&#x27;t come in for class :D Certainly the students who don&#x27;t show up know the consequences of their actions.<br/><br/>Being a great lecturer involves more things than just knowing and transmitting the material. Pavlos would include many memes and interesting quizzes etc to break up the monotony of the class. Making the lecture engaging and fun with gimmicks, although certainly fluff, make it much more enjoyable. I don&#x27;t have data on this, but I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if attendance for Natesh&#x27;s lectures was lower than for Pavlos. I personally didn&#x27;t show up in general and watched the lectures more often than not in general. Perhaps others&#x27; views on this would be more valuable.<br/><br/>I think the quiz system is actually a really great thing. really made me go through material again and make sure I got it. Some of the quiz questions were very gimmes though. The issue sometimes was that you just forget to do them. Thankfully there is the 1&#x2F;3 removal policy.<br/><br/>You know what I really liked: that we had to make steady progress towards our final project. Let me tell you, I am a heavy procrastinator. It was to have the course force me into doing the milestone on time.<br/><br/>OK, time to show some love to Chris. Absolutely legendary Preceptor. Up there with the likes of Kitty Ascrizzi. If you know who she is, you know who I am comparing Chris to. He was always there on Ed. He was there on Office hours that weren&#x27;t his. He had an aura of calmness around him and you could just work while he was talking to the TF and you would just become more aware of everything that you were doing and suddenly start finding solutions to your problems. He is a D&amp;D Paladin with an Aura of Courage feature <br/><br/>I heavily recommend getting python locally and getting used to using a virtual environment. Use venv or your favourite virtual environment creator and thank me later. create a requirements.txt file and use that for each of the psets. <br/><br/>Some Areas that the course could improve upon:<br/><br/>Due to suspected cheating in the coding portion of the exam (some people collaborated or else used LLMs...), the course changed its policy and reduced the weighting of the coding portion of the midterms. I disagree with this policy change.<br/>When a syllabus is published, I consider that as the constitution of that class. Attendance policy, what will be the grading mix etc. So, it unfair to change the policy midway for everyone since I signed up for one constitution and then a coup is changing the constitution midway. Such changes should definitely not be happening after the open add&ndash;drop deadline since it just philosophically feels wrong. Let&#x27;s be honest, the coding portion was my strongest section because I had a lot of experience. But because of actions of some people, my coding portion also got reduced vis&ndash;a&ndash;vis my quiz portion. The solution is simple, you deal with the students who cheated and not make a sweeping change. The course didn&#x27;t even change their policy for the second midterm! So the same things could have happened (and probably did) in the second midterm too.<br/><br/>The first pset on web scraping was, in my opinion way more tedious and hard than originally expected. A couple issues with the website chosen to be scraped was that it had very few Internet Archive records. Thus, creating a big dataset was harder. Morevoer, at first we weren&#x27;t told that the website archives would have such big gaps. So, for a long time, I thought I was messing up my code and wasn&#x27;t finding relevant dates etc. Moreover, some of the Internet Archive records had a different HTML structure and thus my code did not work on them. These things happen in normal web scraping, but the issue is that we didn&#x27;t have a conception how serious we needed to be etc.<br/><br/>Final thoughts:<br/><br/>Overall, a pretty solid A tier class with great support structure. Very nice for beginners though certainly has its hard moments. However, if you&#x27;ve taken 181 and similar data science classes, maybe take a different class since you&#x27;ll cover pretty similar things.<br/>Good luck!<br/>And remember, GTA6 is coming out soon!</td>

I heard 181 is better for that. Also highly recommend reading the textbook. All the lecture quizzes are pulled directly from there and the midterms(which are open note) are very heavily based on it.

Midterms are the big differentiators. <br/><br/><br/>Best part about the course:<br/>The course is pretty practical and dives straight into the code. You develop different models and experiment with hyperparameter tuning that is consistent with modern practices. You also begin to learn the inner workings of artificial intelligence models. It has enough rigor such that anybody who’s more details inclined can dive deeper into certain concepts but anyone who just wants the practical aspect will also have fun with the course. The homeworks were quite fun, and extremely applied(for example one was working on a dataset from an institution in Portugal to find the most viable predictors of academic success among students). Perhaps the only issue I’d have is adding some hints to the open ended projects. Additionally, the background resources on Ed are pretty comprehensive and the textbook is decent.<br/><br/><br/>Worst part about the course:<br/>It can be a time crunch. I never really went to OH for this class and got by fine, but also because the OH started up pretty late. It sometimes felt a little like fill in the blanks, a little repetitive and non informative. Train, do cross validation, pick a model, run it on the test data. This was fine but this is all functionality that ChatGPT could do in a few years&#x2F; is already doing to a great degree of correctness. <br/><br/>TLDR: Pretty fun class. Take it as an elective for computer science. I would not take it as a fifth class, or as a class when you have a pretty demanding schedule. It’s more of a cool class if you do advanced projects&#x2F;projects that you care about with it.</td>

There was no reward for doing so. The class&#x27;s office hours ranged from eh to bad, and the lack of section meant there were very few ways to understand the material. The course content itself was great, just the teaching of it was subpar. I learned more about data science from youtube videos than the class lectures. The class took forever to give grades. This class would be great if it was some online zoom thing where you taught yourself, but it&#x27;s not a course that should be taught in college, especially given its current implementation. I liked the idea of learning datascience, but this class doesn&#x27;t do a good job of teaching it.</td>

Then again, if you got into and wanted to go to Harvard for CS, you might actually enjoy the CS curriculum here. However, most classes are very theoretical, not very applied, and very far removed from the unrestrained spirit of bootstrapped building and programming that drew me (and likely others) to computer science in the first place. Remember: Zuck had to leave Harvard to do anything useful&#x2F;serious with CS. However, CS109(0)A is one of the few classes, since probably CS50 or CS61 for many of you, that allows you to get practical, hands&ndash;on experience with programming and all the good (and bad) that comes with that. If you want a course like that (that&#x27;s your biggest motivator), then feel free to take this course — you will get that. Let me give you a few warnings before though.<br/><br/>This course is taught more like a mix between a TED talk and a YouTube tutorial than anything else. And that is how students treated it — attendance really dropped off in the second half because (it&#x27;s at 9am for crying out loud and) lectures were generally a very surface&ndash;level dive into the topics  they discuss (and yet still they dragged them out quite a bit). This is somewhat hypocritical of me to say with my disclaimer above, but the real practical skills I wanted and got from this course came more from psets and the project, not lectures. Even the weekly &quot;labs&quot; on Fridays didn&#x27;t seem that engaging or hands&ndash;on because Chris was basically just running through the cells of a Jupyter notebook. This class (the lecture component at least) feels not that satisfying because you could not watch the lectures, read the slides thoroughly, and feel adequately prepared for the midterms. <br/><br/>The midterms and other assignments are another thing to discuss. We had two midterms + a project (no actual final), but the last midterm was during the start of finals period, so it wasn&#x27;t that convenient (a lot shorter in time though). Each midterm had two components: (1) a coding take home part to be done over a three hour period sometime over a few days (but really was just redoing labs — and you could rerun &#x2F; recheck your code against tests til you got a full score), and (2) an in&ndash;person 1hr 15min exam during class time. It was taken on Ed with open notes&#x2F;open internet (no GenAI though), so you have to take good notes on lectures and review the quizzes (it had some tricky questions, but wasn&#x27;t that bad).  The quizzes are annoying, but make sure to take them consistently before every class. 1&#x2F;3 were dropped but if you forgot one or two, you might turn them into long stretches of not doing them, which was precarious.<br/><br/>Here is where the course did good though:<br/>&ndash; Pavlos is a genuinely funny person. You will enjoy him, his energy, and his humor if not because of the contrast with other profs but because of how early this course is (9am, which was pushed back from 9:45 historically).<br/>&ndash; The project! It&#x27;s a true slog across the semester (5 milestones in total across a few months) and very, very open&ndash;ended. Find a good topic (and good, easy to use data if you want to save yourself a lot of hassle) and it will be a lot more interesting to you. Even though it took like 2&#x2F;3rds of the semester, each individual milestone didn&#x27;t feel that crazy, and you can really rely on&#x2F;ask questions to your TF for feedback, ideas, etc. Plus, forcing you to start early definitely led to a much better end product, so this was a fun experience to build cool models and answer interesting questions with my friends. Don&#x27;t procrastinate if you can, but you can probably do a lot of the milestones in the few days before they&#x27;re due.<br/>&ndash; The chillness of this course. It&#x27;s not terribly stressful for the most part. It&#x27;s not a walk in the park ofc &ndash; you will still have the inevitable pset or milestone that you put to the last minute and need to really push through for. But I think this is why so many people take it and recommend it. You will not face the same difficulty as, say, CS124, so enjoy that.<br/>&ndash; You get hands&ndash;on experience with coding. I mentioned this before, but it&#x27;s genuinely such a huge appeal to this course and why I would recommend to many CS students still. The psets are actually decently interesting, especially the Kaggle one where you have to submit a bunch of models you made your own decisions for to three Kaggle leaderboards. The project is another place to actually work with real&ndash;life data and questions and potentially push the field a little bit. It&#x27;s been actually fun to program and make things. Then again, maybe we&#x27;ll all be replaced by OpenAl&#x27;s 03 or o33 model in the future, so take everything with a grain of salt and do what you like&#x2F;want :&#x2F;</td>

Top 5 for sure. I feel like every class I walked away feeling like I had learned something which is so rare. The first semester was really difficult because I was catching up on linear algebra and calculus but the second semester felt so much better. Once I had the foundational stuff down, I was able to focus on just the concepts—that made everything so much more manageable.

That being said, the staff, in my opinion, is subpar.    Assignments take, at a minimum, 2 weeks to be graded, which is fairly frustrating since it is very difficult to gauge your progress throughout the semester, and course staff are generally fairly distant from students.  This is understandable as it is a very large course, and it is probably difficult if not impossible to be engaged with every student, but the class could have been set up in such a way for there to be a better hierarchy.  It is generally a bit confusing who to reach out to for a question or problem, as there are so many course heads, and the teaching fellows are generally less knowledgeable.   Midterm and final are deceptively difficult and also frustrating for those who do not use ChatGPT as an aid (the midterm is composed of a take&ndash;home coding portion and an in&ndash;class multiple choice; you can guess what happens to the take&ndash;home portion, even though generative AI is prohibited).   <br/>On the bright side, the material in the course is very interesting, the assignments are generally manageable, and, as mentioned before, the lectures are usually quite entertaining.

The material itself is very reasonable and not too difficult to understand. Pavlos is an entertaining lecturer who also presents the material in a logical fashion. HOWEVER! This class has an INSANE number of assignments. I think previous Q guide reports really played down how much time goes into this class. Even though the material is not difficult, the biweekly psets are LONG, even with a partner to split up the work. The real kicker is the final project deadline stacked on top of the final midterm.

Pavlos is a great entertaining lecturer, Chris is solid, but Natesh moves really slow. Stay on top of the psets a little more as they actually contribute the most to your grade (around 40%), but doing them I realized how useful and great AI is at coding. The course has you code in Python which can be tedious for these psets as the coding part is not what is really important to learn (imo) but rather how the data science models work and which is the best one to use. The labs are not useful at all so I would not end up going and the exercises in the Ed are a waste of time.

I was uncertain that I would take this course given my commitments and the q&ndash;guide reports stating how challenging the material was, however, I am so grateful that I chose to enroll. <br/><br/>My background was CS50, CS20, Math 21a, AM 22a, AM50, and Stat 110. I also had experience with Pandas, Jupyter Notebook, and predictive modeling in Python (AM50). The true prerequisites ought to be CS50 or CS32 and Math 21a. Having predictive modeling (in Python), linear algebra, and probability knowledge is most certainly helpful but unnecessary to having an amazing CS1090a experience. <br/><br/>Advantages of CS109a:<br/><br/>0. The professors are incredible. Pavlos is a sight for sore (and heavy) eyes at 9am. Pavlos is the funniest and most engaging CS professor I have had, and he takes time to get to know each of his students. He cares for your learning, making it a truly special learning environment. Natesh is incredible in his ability to inspire students about the importance and use cases of the material. He also deeply cares about students&#x27; learning as he spends a portion of lecture time gauging students&#x27; understanding of the material.  <br/><br/>1. The TFs are incredible. Chris and Elaine are the most supportive TF I have had at Harvard. It felt like they were always available to help with any problem or issue, whether at their OH or on Ed. <br/><br/>2. On that note there is incredible support. The course has multiple office hours every week, held virtually and all across campus. The Ed discussion is always active and TFs reply fairly quickly. There are some cases of egregious amount of waiting time for a response, that is usually towards the end of the semester. The amount of support gives a great opportunity to succeed in the course.<br/><br/>3. The material itself is an incredible introduction to Data Science and machine learning. The material covered is widely applicable to other STEM topics. I noticed a significant overlap in Math 21a, AM115, and AM121 material. Additionally, there is optional extra work available on Ed which allows one to dive into greater detail into Data Science or other programming concepts. <br/><br/>4. Bi&ndash;weekly partner psets are so clutch. There is also a generous late day policy. Need I say more?<br/><br/>5. The course organization is superb. Everything you need is on Ed. Except the class recordings, those are on Canvas. <br/><br/>Things to take into account before enrolling:<br/><br/>0. The psets are time&ndash;consuming. Whilst true in that they get easier as the semester goes on, they are still a significant time commitment. I usually took anywhere between 10&ndash;20 hours to complete a pset, and I completed all except one pset on my own. Remember, the psets are bi&ndash;weekly. So this meant spending around 1 hour or 1.5 hours a day on the pset. Procrastinating on psets in this course can be awful and cause one to fall behind. Also, some of the psets are frustrating, in that the material covered in the pset is useless to other concepts in the class (HW1web scraping) or they are incredibly vague whilst still being heavily penalized (like HW5).<br/><br/>1. The course is fast&ndash;paced for sure. Understanding the topics completely is a demanding task, and one where one must spend significant time dedicated to the material. The content is usually iterative, so to understand future concepts, one must understand the previous concepts! I took CS109a with another relatively intense math course, and two relatively easier courses, so I was able to spend this needed time on the material. I never took a break from this class. Honestly, everyday I was doing something related to the course, whether working on my pset, going over class notes, or rewatching a lecture. The time commitment only grows as the semester goes on. Sure, the psets may get a little easier but the project demands get harder. The content also gets more challenging. The end of the semester during Thanksgiving break and after is like all cylinders firing, with the lectures&#x2F;project&#x2F;exam&#x2F;final psets. So, really, there is no break from CS109a. <br/><br/><br/>As a final word, I genuinely think this class is amazing. It certainly beats CS50 and CS20 for me in terms of material covered, the use cases of the material, and enjoyment. Take this class and don&#x27;t look back!</td>

However, it is not an easy class and takes up an incredible amount of time. There is always something due every week that will take at least six hours or more, on top of three lectures and two quizzes per week. <br/><br/>The final project is challenging, and your grade will heavily depend on how well your TF provides feedback. To succeed, you need to watch every lecture (don&#x27;t cram), complete all quizzes, start the problem sets well before the due date, and choose your final project group carefully. However, this class has to be your #1 priority to manage everything. If you are taking other hard classes alongside this one, you likely won’t get an A, as it requires an enormous amount of work.

Super interesting and applicable to many fields of interest. The final project is split into milestones so that you are not stuck doing the whole project at the last minute, which is nice. It was great to get feedback at each step of the way. Highly recommend this class.</td>

Also WHY are the grad&#x2F;masters&#x2F;PhD people taking this course as part of their requirements that&#x27;s ridiculous bro i just wanted an INTRO to data science course and i&#x27;m with these people with 398204 years of experience Anyway. pavlos is really great honestly his lectures are very engaging and he&#x27;s Funny. the psets are kinda fun sometimes and there are a lot of late days to take advantage of. also the EdBoard is very helpful! idk just put more time in to understand the concepts because learning adaboost at 9am was Not It.</td>

I think the amount you get out is equal to the amount you put in—I took the class pass fail and was intending to do that to limit my stress and just learn the material but realized quickly that it would take a lot of time that I didn’t have to learn the amount I wanted to learn. So if you’re in my shoes I’d recommend either deciding you want to invest a lot in this class or just not taking it because I kind of feel like I wasted my time.

Lectures often are unclear which information is vital and feel like there is only 30m of actual takeaways embedded within them. Labs can be skipped entirely with virtually no consequence on your learning. They need to highlight too, imo, when they&#x27;re explaining math that is important to understand but not memorize and when it is important to know deeply. There is also way too many tedious little assignments to complete sometimes. Still, I&#x27;d recommend the course if you wanna get a hold on data science.</td>

You can tell that the course staff are really passionate about the material and excited to help you learn it. The class is also very unique from other CS classes in that it teaches you how to actually implement its material in practice much more than other classes do. I am surprised by how many data science techniques I can now implement in practice that I wouldn&#x27;t have been able to at the start of the semester. This is because in the class we always used out&ndash;of&ndash;the&ndash;box implementations of data science algorithms from sklearn, while in other classes this would not be allowed and you would need to code the algorithms from scratch. I think this was a good thing (even though I 100% agree that coding algorithms from scratch is very helpful for your theoretical understanding of how they work), because in the real world you would just use sklearn anyway, and allowing us to use the out&ndash;of&ndash;the&ndash;box implementations just saved time for us to explore lots of different techniques.<br/><br/>CON:<br/><br/>My one complaint is that the TFs were frustratingly nitpicky when grading homeworks, taking off points when they didn&#x27;t like the wording of how a plot was labeled, when I answered a vaguely&ndash;worded conceptual question in a way that was correct but didn&#x27;t mention one specific thing they were looking for, and for lots of other equally minor things. This made it feel like I was walking on eggshells when doing the homeworks, trying to avoid losing points for minor things. It actually made me learn less from the homeworks than I would have otherwise, because I was so focused on not losing points instead of actually getting excited about the interesting techniques that were covered on each homework. At the end of the day, though, there were so many other opportunities besides homework to earn easy points that my final grade ended up being exactly what I wanted it to be anyway.</td>

I took this class because I never got comfortable working with pandas and data science using python (I&#x27;m more of an R person), and I&#x27;m glad I did because the psets are pretty thorough and now I feel a lot more comfortable with python data science after the hands&ndash;on practice. However, the only reason I&#x27;m having an okay time in this class is because I&#x27;m a stat major and have taken years of CS courses, so not only have I learned all the math&#x2F;stat concepts before but I also am very familiar with coding and learning from new documentation. If I were a complete beginner at CS and&#x2F;or haven&#x27;t taken a stat class before, this class would be rough because they throw so many new things at you very quickly. Overall, if you just want more hands&ndash;on practice I would recommend CS 1090a, but if you just want to learn the stat or the models, you&#x27;re better off taking a real linear models or machine learning course.</td>

The homework are graded insanely specific, not based on if you do it right but if you do it exactly how they did it. Exams require you to know how to do calculations that have never been taught, they give no practices. It was a course I was genuinely excited for first day and now the reason I am no longer going to take any other CS classes. That being said, it probably is a gimme class if you&#x27;ve done any kind of stats before.</td>

The homeworks are all coding, but the professors only lecture on conceptual skills (and also mostly test the concepts on exams too). It seems the form of evaluation does not align with what the professors are teaching, and the structure of the course probably needs to move away from just having coding notebooks as the homework sets. That said, Pavlos is an enthusiastic lecturer who keeps things interesting. But the difficulty ranges wildly from topic to topic in this class. It starts out really easy, and then the last couple weeks are insanely hard. Do not expect for this course to take a steady amount of hours each week, as that number will wildly fluctuate.</td>
