Go to lecture, do the p&ndash;sets yourself, spend two hours every day recapping what you learned in lecture, and go ask questions the second you have them. That will make the PIEs so much easier, as they require that you stay on top of your material but also have enough mastery of the material to do the exam in 45 minutes (it goes by SO fast). Pay attention in section, and do the practice problems. This class has all the resources for you to do well, so you need to make sure you have the time and dedication to use those resources well. If you can do all that, you will get an A—no problem.</td>

Andrew Berry and Scott Edwards are so funny and make class so enjoyable you have to love the class. For students who aren&#x27;t strong in bio like me, don&#x27;t fall behind in the material this class moves very quickly and even though you can get by with being a procrastinator it will make your life miserable when a PIE comes around. The lecture notes are the greatest resource, if you are stumped on a pset question I guarantee the lecture notes will make the question seem easy.</td>

Most of you are probably going to take this for a pre&ndash;med or concentration requirement, and you can&#x27;t avoid it so here are some tips:<br/><br/>1. The course DOES get better throughout the semester. I failed the first PIE. Not just in a like &quot;haha I failed&quot; way, but I actually FAILED. 23&#x2F;40. Big fat F. But, it gets better, I got over a 90 on all of the other PIEs. I would say the content on the first PIE is the hardest, but also I learned better study habits so don&#x27;t drop the class or be too discouraged if you fail the first one like I did. Thank God for the PIE drop! <br/>2. Be mindful about your study sheet. For the first PIE I wrote in .5 font and literally all the information on the notes, which obviously didn&#x27;t work. I would suggest writing and drawing the graphs off of the lecture slides, and use Chat GPT to help you understand and summarize the notes if you don&#x27;t understand what Dr. Berry or Dr. Edwards is saying. Lowkey, sometimes the practice PIEs were NOTHING like the real PIEs (especially 1 and 4), so don&#x27;t fret too much if you don&#x27;t COMPLETELY understand the practice PIEs.<br/>3. Switch your section if you have a bad TF. Your TF will grade your PSETs, so you want to make sure you have a chill TF. Also, they will get more leniant as the semester goes on, I did really bad on the first couple of PSETs, but after than got 40&#x2F;40. <br/>4. Find OH that go through the whole PSET. If Anthony is there, go to his OH, he is the GOAT and will go through the whole thing. Also, check your PSETs with others in the class because sometimes the TFs will give you wrong answers.<br/>5. The OH get cancelled all. of. the. time. It is SO annoying, and apparently this has been happening for years. <br/><br/>If you&#x27;re debating whether or not to take this with PS11, do it. PS11 is ran super well, and taking both at the same time is definitely doable. There isn&#x27;t too much overlap between the PIEs and midterms, except you will have an exam every week, which sucks, but a lot of other people are in the same boat. I think there was only 1 time we had back&ndash;to&ndash;back PIE to midterm. You don&#x27;t want to wait to take any of these classes when you&#x27;re an upper classman. I took LPSA, and the transition from LPSA to PS11 gives you a HUGE advantage, but if you took LS1a you will have a slight advantage to LS1b, so it&#x27;s a tradeoff. Though I think that LPSA prepares you better for PS11 than LS1a does for LS1b. <br/><br/>As we learned at the beginning of this course, &quot;Get help before you get sad.&quot; This is so true. GET HELP ASAP THIS IS A HARD AND POORLY RAN CLASS.</td>

The main problem with the course is that the exams are nothing like the psets, I was great with the psets but on the exams, I struggled! The only way to get a sense of what type of questions the pies would have is practice problems. Make sure you don&#x27;t fall behind on information, try to pay attention! Labs are a little unhelpful cause they dont have a lot of problems on section worksheet.

Keep in mind that Berry isn&#x27;t teaching LS1B next year, so you&#x27;ll probably get lectures that are neither entertaining or understandable. Scott&#x27;s lectures were just like that. <br/><br/>With PSETS, they basically dock off points for any slight mistake, so get used to missing marks regardless of how many times you check your PSET. Make sure to find a study group to check PSETs with though!<br/><br/>PIEs (our exams) are 40 mins (too short imo). The first one is overly hard; it get&#x27;s better as time goes on. Do all the practice PIEs twice and revisit questions you got wrong on the PSETs. Give yourself 35 minutes for the practice PIES to prepare you for the short time limit. Request regrade whenever you can as long as you have a valid reason. I did once and got 2 points back (5% higher grade!). <br/><br/>The material in general is not overly difficult or complicated, but the way you are tested on it and asked to apply it makes it a little confusing.

Please go to office hours for the PSET. Start it early and go to office hours if you have any questions. There were so many times were I was able to finish my PSET during office hours. <br/>3. For this class, there was no midterm, but there were 4 PIEs, and the final exam counts for 3 PIEs. PIEs were every like two weeks, so make sure you are studying ahead of time. Also, that being said, there was always a test, and PIEs make up most of your grade (55%). The class is really test&ndash;based, so it does weigh on you a little bit. <br/>4.

I think that if the course is your main focus&#x2F;one of your main focuses for the semester it could be better. If you can avoid the class, I would recommend that. But it&#x27;s unavoidable for a lot of people. <br/><br/>The format of the lectures is almost too focused on jokes to the point that it&#x27;s sometimes hard to actually learn from them. A lot of the office hours are terrible (it&#x27;s hard to get individual questions answered and I have had TFs tell me that they &quot;have been told to lead me astray if I have the right answer&quot; on an assignment). The Lab&#x2F;Section often just has way too many activities packed into one 3 hour time slot. The PIEs being 40 minutes makes the the opposite of &quot;low pressure&quot;. The first PIE was WAY harder than anything we have seen thus far and had a 40 minute time limit. It was acknowledged that the PIE was bad but nothing was done about the very low average. However, I have heard that year after year people say the same things about the first PIE being too hard, the lectures being unhelpful, etc. and nothing is ever changed so. <br/><br/>However, they do give you a LOT of resources to help you figure it out. I found that the amount of practice problems and lecture notes they provide along with exam reviews were super helpful. So, it&#x27;s doable and if you have to do it, you&#x27;ll be okay but just be mentally prepared going in.</td>

Andrew Berry is a great lecturer, but he is no longer teaching the course, which is really sad. Dr. Edwards is super nice and charismatic, and he gives great lectures as well.

I think the best way to study is to make your cheat sheet, and do literally every single practice problem they provide you (practice tests, psets, the practice questions associates with lecture). The PIEs are not really as scary as they seem — they&#x27;re totally manageable within the 40 minutes you&#x27;re allotted if you&#x27;re solid on the material and can write fast!</td>

The office hours and SSNs are held at really inconvenient times &amp; not much variety in timing, and TFs often cancel OHs with &lt;1 hr notice or just don&#x27;t show up especially on Zoom, which compounds this issue. Additionally, grades are returned VERY late and PIE regrades even more so (2+ weeks needed), which is really inconvenient as many times pset grades will not be released but material from that pset is on the PIE the next day. Sure, you can look at the pset answer keys, but it&#x27;s really much more helpful to see what you personally got wrong, because obviously there is usually some flexibility with answers, and the answer key isn&#x27;t the only correct answer&#x2F;way to phrase things ever. This next thing is true for many courses, but I just noticed it a lot for LS1b, but your TF really makes or breaks the class. Some TFs are extremely harsh graders, taking off many points and leaving no comments to explain why on psets, don&#x27;t go over material during section&#x2F;lab, and, only speaking for the TF I had experience with, are just not suitable for teaching (i.e. swear a lot, very aggressive&#x2F;loves to yell at no provocation, etc.).

LS1B aims to cover a lot of interesting material from many disciplines but combined with the PIE system, makes for a complicated experience. The motivation of PIES are to provide lower&ndash;stakes periodic testing of knowledge along the way. However, PIEs feel rushed overall (40 minutes vs typical midterm exam of the 1&ndash;hr 15&ndash;30 min) and can be a bit ambivalent&ndash;feeling. For a given PIE question, which is out of 40 points, a single question can cost anywhere between 1 and 5 points a part, so one part incorrect feels like a large setback. This semester, PIE testing only covered up to lectures 19, so the rest of 20&ndash;28 was uncharted and only really has homework as a means of getting feedback on how you are doing.  Read the notes they give after the class and do the practice problems. Aside from the section practice problems, Lab is a separate experience from lecture and expects some degree of researching paper writing experience that isn&#x27;t really covered.

The lectures were a little dense sometimes, but the section was fun, and the PSETS were also a very reasonable length. I will say that there was a lot bigger of emphasis on heredity and evolution than I expected, but it was very interesting to learn about these topics. Overall, I would recommend taking it!</td>

However, the course assignments like the PSETs and Midterms (“PIEs”) require a lot of commitment from the class. Even the brightest biology mind has to adapt to this course, as its pedagogy is very particular (the formatting&#x2F;question style for exams). Even some definitions, like what classifies as a “chromatid” are inconsistent across other biological pedagogies. Moreover, the exam timing requires students to be REALLY focused and quick in their recall of information, as it’s very unforgiving. Getting an A is very possible, but quite difficult.</td>

Andrew Berry is a fantastic lecturer, and maybe it&#x27;s just the accent, but he can make anything interesting. It can feel at times like the course is not structured for you to succeed, but don&#x27;t worry! Once you learn what the instructors are asking for, it becomes pretty straightforward to do well. If you&#x27;re reading this you probably have to take LS1b anyways, so I won&#x27;t try to convince you that you should. Instead, here are some tips to do well (from somebody who currently has a 96% in the class):<br/><br/>1. Start studying for the PIEs a week in advance. You only have 40 minutes, so you need to be familiar with the concepts to the point where you can skim a question and immediately know what it&#x27;s asking you to do. The schedule that worked for me was spending four days reviewing each lecture on the exam, doing practice problems, and making my cheat sheet, two days taking practice exams, and one day reviewing everything for good measure.<br/><br/>2. Lab is more intense than LS1a&#x2F;LPSA. Read the manual beforehand and be prepared for the lab quiz. When doing lab assignments, read every question carefully because they have a rubric that they follow to the T.<br/><br/>3. Start psets early! I would usually start mine Saturday, the day after they&#x27;re assigned, and do everything that we&#x27;d learned how to do (usually 50&ndash;66% of the pset). Then, finish it Monday or Tuesday after Monday&#x27;s lecture, and check your answers at office hours on Wednesday or Thursday. That gives you a day of buffer (Friday), and ensures that you aren&#x27;t just getting answers from office hours without understanding the material.<br/><br/>4. Have fun!!</td>

You don&#x27;t need to pay attention in lecture other than to do the polleverywhere&#x27;s. Before the PIE&#x27;s, you only need 6&ndash;7 hours of prep. <br/>1. Read the lecture notes from the 4&ndash;5 lessons that the PIE is on. Spend 2&ndash;3 HOURS on this. Even though its only 40 pages or so, its VERY DENSE. Do not move on to the next sentence until you understand everything in the previous one. <br/>2. Take practice test 1. You will get a bad score on this (around 60 percent). Don&#x27;t worry, you haven&#x27;t been prepped to do this type of question yet. <br/>3. Reread the lecture notes at the same pace, but make a cheat sheet while doing it. On this cheat sheet, just write down everything that you come across that you didn&#x27;t already have memorized&#x2F;known. Also include a section for tips on how to approach tricky parts of the questions on test 1. <br/>4. Take practce test 2. You will not be perfect here either (80&ndash;90), but you will now have seen every type of question they can throw at you and you will be ready. <br/>Don&#x27;t bother with the practice questions, they aren&#x27;t indicative of how to do the actual PIE questions. If you are really worried, you can do them, but don&#x27;t think they are like the practice tests. <br/>This is a foolproof method. I perfected it throughout the year and as a result Ls1b became my lightest class. I also had some of my friends who weren&#x27;t doing well try it, and they got A&#x27;s as well. It works. <br/>Good luck, and remember, its up to you to get an A, lock in.</td>

Because the PIEs are so frequent, each one counts for a relatively small portion of your grade, so try not to treat them like you would a major midterm. Go to office hours, even if you don’t have anything in particular to ask. Dr. Berry and Dr. Edwards are both super helpful and fun to talk to in general!

They ask too many questions that are beyond reasonable expectations of what can be completed within 40 minutes for PIES and 2.5 hours for the final. Also, don&#x27;t think that coming from LPSA, you&#x27;ll have a disadvantage, because even those who took LS1a (myself included) will struggle in the beginning, because this course is completely different. Labs are very student&ndash;led, and TFs don&#x27;t help you much, which is very frustrating in the beginning because you&#x27;ve probably never done or seen any of this before, but labs do get easier and enjoyable.

Yes the PIEs are scary, but they definitely get better as you go along and learn how to study from them and what to put on your cheat sheet. My only gripe with this class is that a ton of your grade is TF dependent. I had some classmates whose grades were being held afloat by their labs and PSETs, while personally mine was being held down. It&#x27;s definitely a luck of the draw in that respect as, although there are standardized points deductions, some of the TFs are chill while some take it way. too. seriously.</td>

And it is really fine overall &ndash;&ndash;&ndash; Section has incredible reviews of the learned content, there are like a million office hours, and they always post the lecture slides and deeply, deeply useful lecture notes THAT I STRONGLY RECOMMEND YOU USE TO STUDY FOR PIES!!!

Lecture teaches you basically NOTHING. All the information that I got about the course concepts was from the lecture notes after I had to attend the lecture and from section from my TF. Also, DR. ANDREW BERRY is not productive in teaching the course materials. He spends too much time focusing on constructing his silly persona than teaching us what we need to know. He tries too hard to be funny and gets political randomly here and there throughout lecture, which is not what you&#x27;re supposed to expect from a teacher at Harvard. The highlight of the year was seeing the other lecturer speak for a couple lectures, and I learned more in those few lectures than I did in 20+ from Berry. If you&#x27;re premed like me then you need to take this course then I&#x27;m sorry :( but maybe it gets better in the future. I will hold my reservations, but please proceed with caution and try to be engaged in section and in the lecture notes because you get basically nothing out of lecture.

There is genuinely so much that you have to know for the final, and you will feel super overwhelmed (especially with how absurd the practice finals are), but it will be ok (the final for us was 31 pages in 2.5 hours).  They are also super secretive about the grading in this class. I have heard the A would be a 94 or 95, but someone said they got an A with a 91 before, so it is just whatever the teaching team wishes to set it as. <br/><br/>Finally, Andrew Berry is amazing. He has a lot of energy and is very enthusiastic about the material. BUT Scott Edwards is horrible. He is terrible at explaining the content and it confuses you even more when you talk to him. You are probably taking LS1B because of being pre&ndash;med or for your major, so good luck, but if you are not, THEN WHY??? There are other good classes out there!</td>

The lectures are engaging, labs are pretty easy&#x2F;low stakes, and the workload is fairly manageable. Instead of midterms they split the material into 4 &quot;PIEs&quot;, which makes studying much less difficult for each exam. They also don&#x27;t have lab or PSETs on the week of PIEs so you have plenty of time to study. The workload in this class is pretty light. Just 1 PSET a week and a lab assignment for the first half of the course. There are 2 lab research papers but both aren&#x27;t terribly long and most of the work is done in lab. 90% of the people who take this class probably have to for pre&ndash;med or concentration requirements, so I&#x27;m not going to convince anyone but just know this class is pretty easy and not that much work. The first PIE was pretty difficult but they apologized  and the rest of them were considerably easier.</td>

Felt like AP Bio part 2 with extra details here and there. Came in with just LPSA the previous semester and didn&#x27;t feel a significant difference in difficulty. The PIEs are super annoying but if you do math, given that you score high 90s in psets, you can actually score pretty badly and get an A in theory. So when they said it&#x27;s low stakes, they actually mean it. But of course, it&#x27;s filled with first year pre&ndash;meds so people will be super dramatic and freak out (but please don&#x27;t).<br/><br/>For PIEs, I would suggest doing the following: read the lecture notes. They are wonderful. Don&#x27;t waste your time rewatching the lecture videos &ndash;&ndash; the lecture notes contain nicely written out details of all you need to know. Once you&#x27;ve read the lecture notes, read any following tutorials. Then try a practice PIE without any notes. It doesn&#x27;t have to be time&ndash;limited necessarily &ndash;&ndash; just force yourself to stare at the problem until you can figure it out. The struggle is worth your brain learning how to solve the problem. Then watch the review session video (I always skipped that class but if you went it&#x27;s ok). The most important thing is to hammer out the practice problems. They are AMAZING. I didn&#x27;t realize how similar they are to PIE questions until it was too late. If you don&#x27;t have time to do them without looking at the key, it helps to just download a PDF of the key and annotate the solutions, making sure you know how to do them. Once you feel confident, take the second practice PIE timed, no materials. Then after grading your PIE, consolidate what you NEED to have on a sheet and make your sheet last. Ideally you don&#x27;t need the sheet &ndash;&ndash; it&#x27;s a safety mechanism because Ls1b is not TOO concerned with little random facts&#x2F;details. <br/><br/>I think if you have the outlined study regiment as listed above, you&#x27;ll be fine. Of course, attend section. Attending lecture is not super necessary in my opinion as long as you read the lecture notes. Definitely try to solve the PSETs on your own. This class is definitely doable. I personally found AP Bio knowledge to help me immensely.</td>

If it&#x27;s required cuz you&#x27;re pre&ndash;med, great! It&#x27;s really fun, the topics are quite interesting, and everything interconnects very well. PSETs are reasonable. PIEs are also mostly reasonable (Professor Berry did publicly apologize after like a 73 average on PIE 1 BUT THAT NEVER HAPPENED AGAIN SO ITS OK) and you get one PIE drop. The final was also reasonable but I had to lock the heck in and it seemed like it should have had less questions for 2.5 hours. It matched the 2 practice finals pretty well. Professor Berry isn&#x27;t teaching next year so I&#x27;m not sure how well these Q&ndash;guides will reflect the course because he was a highlight for being super enthusiastic.

The PIEs count for much of your final grade and are not the &quot;low stakes&quot; model that LS 1a introduced. They are on Mondays, so you have to say goodbye to your entire weekend if you want to do well. On that conversation, this year, the first PIE had too many questions and was really hard, so many people didn&#x27;t finish. As a result, almost the whole class had to use their 1 PIE drop immediately. There is a ton of pressure to do well in these exams, and it is rough having to devote every other weekend to ensuring you can at least get a decent score. Every PIE I felt like I didn&#x27;t have enough time to do it and always finished the last question at the last moment. The final exam is another point of concern. It was 30 pages this year, and I didn&#x27;t even finish the full test within the 2 hours and 30 minutes allotted. It&#x27;s those things that really annoy me about LS 1b. You can know all the material, but it&#x27;s the way the course examination system is structured that prevents you from adequately expressing what you know and getting a good grade. Hopefully, the exam system will be changed by the time you take it, but my biggest advice, if it is not, is to start studying on Saturday and continue into Sunday if you want to do well! You got this!</td>

Do not underestimate the first PIE, most of our class bombed it because we didn&#x27;t take it very seriously and didn&#x27;t do the practice problems.
