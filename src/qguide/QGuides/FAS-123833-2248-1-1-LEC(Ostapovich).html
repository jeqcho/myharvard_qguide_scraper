I think both have a lot of ups and downs. For LPSA, the coursework may be too demanding for someone with no experience but very slow for anyone with any AP experience. I took this class because I was worried about my chemistry knowledge. The last time I took chemistry before this course was sophomore year of high school, and I never learned about solubility or acids and bases. I found this class to be very easy and boring at times. I definitely don&#x27;t regret taking the class though. Many of my LS1A peers were much more stressed out than I was. If you are worried about the pace being too slow, probably take LS1A. However, I have heard from LS1A students that they end up learning very little. <br/>I did really like the teaching staff. Tucci is super interested in the subject, and he&#x27;s a very lively lecturer for 9AM. I also enjoyed the demonstrations, and the labs were very nice. I especially liked my lab TF. Dr. Boselli is very nice too, and she&#x27;s always willing to answer questions.<br/>While I did not attend help rooms, I was told they were extremely helpful to most students. If you are worried about receiving support, I strongly recommend LPSA. The staff will help you with any questions you have step by step. <br/>In terms of exams, as far as I&#x27;m aware, the LS1A exams are much easier. They are given a cheat sheet, and people say they&#x27;re easier than the PIEs. However, LPSA still has plenty of prep materials for the exam, and a lot of students do extremely well on them. <br/>I would recommend this course. I think it was a great course to take my freshmen fall.</td>

			<td class="TabularBody_LeftColumn" headers="comment-2_2eec8e79-510e-4156-9049-fca824e8c2cd">As a course, LPSA is extremely interesting and engaging due to the course&#x27;s structure and focus on both Biology and Chemistry. Although the course is difficult at times, especially due to the contrast in topics covered, the amount of support provided allows everyone in the class to have the resources necessary to succeed and perform to the best of their abilities. While the course does have 3 midterms, a final, 12 problem sets and 4 Lab assignments, the almost endless amount of help rooms, peer coaching, and other forms of support make the daunting task of completing the course bearable. In particular, the TF for the course, Joe Gonzalez, was an immense help in the course, and provided great amounts of support, especially before exams. Overall, this course serves as an excellent introduction into the sciences at Harvard and teaches both important material on Biology and Chemistry, but on how to be a better learner as well.</td>

The classes allow you to recap some initial concepts while introducing more advanced ideas, which allowed me to develop the confidence to continue pursuing a career in this field. Some advice:<br/>&ndash;Make sure you follow ALL THE LECTURES, I know that 9am is challenging, but it&#x27;s worth it and everything will be much clearer after a good class.<br/>&ndash;The sections are extremely useful, especially if you have questions in Pset, since we basically solve questions very similar to those that will be there<br/>&ndash;Dedicate yourself to the Laboratory as much as possible, especially if you are a freshman. It was an opportunity to have my first contact with equipment that, at least for me, I had never seen, which took a lot of time to understand but was also very intriguing. <br/>&ndash;Finally, keep in mind that this course takes a lot of time and will be one of the ones you will have to dedicate the most to in your semester. Set aside time to read the pre&ndash;lectures, solve exercises and, above all, GO TO THE HELP ROOMS IN ADVANCE.</td>

The teaching staff is so kind and helpful in explaining concepts and they will save your problem set grade. Exams are extremely fair and often easier than the practice exams provided.

Greg Tucci is a magnificent lecturer, and he made the chemistry portion of this class incredibly engaging. I found the chemistry portion of LPSA to be far and away the best part of the course, as the biology half was rather boring and taught with less enthusiasm. This made lectures a bit of a pain to sit through occasionally, but the content is of course still interesting and fundamental if you&#x27;re going to take more biology courses at Harvard. Jaewook is an incredible section leader and made section such a pleasure every week!

If you have no background in AP Chem of AP Bio the class will be VERY fast paced and you will have to pull your weight and study a lot. There is a lot of content to go over in a semester (basically the entirety of general chemistry and then basic cellular biology concepts), so the class will constantly feel fast paced. Go to help room EARLY to get psets done and explanations. Section is helpful to clarify confusing topics throughout the week&#x27;s lectures. This class took up so much of my time and was difficult at times, but once you gain good study habits and find your rhythm, it&#x27;s manageable.  I&#x27;ve learned a lot during this semester and have developed a deeper interest for cellular biology and would now say I&#x27;m on the same level as my LS1A peers or my peers with prior AP science experience. As for the final and tests, there are an abundance of resources to do well and study. Practice problems, practice tests, exam reviews and videos, and section handouts are all great resources to do well. Repetition is key for this class.</td>

The chemistry component is not very conceptual and is instead heavily focused on computations and basically solving math problems using the equations they give you, so once you know how to identify which equation to apply to which problem, you will be fine. I had a great section leader, so that is a great place to ask questions in a smaller setting and review problems that look very similar to the questions on the problem set (I found that I was able to complete the problem sets much more efficiently when I waited until after my section to complete them). The amount of work you have is reasonable and the lab reports are not long, but still start earlier and go to office hours with any questions. Since the class is so large, office hours are almost always crowded, but it&#x27;s worth it to go, even if you have to wait before asking your questions, to get any issues sorted out before you submit your work. The professor will definitely tell you this, but doing practice tests and practice problems is a far more effective way of studying than reading the textbook, so just be wise in your test prep and you shouldn&#x27;t see any surprises on it.</td>

It gets you to the same place and is easier (or so I&#x27;ve heard) and if you are more interested in chemistry, this is a heavier chemistry &#x2F; lighter biology class. Also I recommend if you miss a lecture watch crash course biology&#x2F;chemistry videos on the concept BEFORE you look at the annotated lecture&#x2F;watch the recording. It makes it easier to pay attention when you have background on the lecture especially since you are doing it alone.</td>

The curve and the grading is much better in this class, and there seem to be more resources to support students. I feel like if you want a refresher in chem before upper level classes, this is the class for you. LS1A is more bio focused.</td>

I think the chem is taught really well and clearly. I&#x27;ve taken like half a year of pandemic chemistry in high school and felt super confused, but this course cleared up a bunch of holes for me. If you are debating between LPS A and LS1A, I would recommend LPS A if you want to brush up&#x2F;solidify your chem (especially if you are considering a chem concentration). Besides it&#x27;s probably much easier to get an A in LPS A (the bio stuff, for instance, felt like a repeat of AP Biology and I heard the chem stuff is a repeat of AP Chem) if you&#x27;re concerned about pre&ndash;med GPA. <br/><br/>I think this course is really well&ndash;taught and it&#x27;s a very standard intro course. As long as you do the practice exams you will do fine on the exams. They say to take notes after lecture and do the practice problems but I didn&#x27;t do that and I was fine. Just make sure to go to section and do all the psets. I will say that the bio part felt a bit annoying as there were always random little rules I forgot here and there while chem is just straightforward solving the same types of problems over and over again. <br/><br/>I&#x27;d also like to mention that I&#x27;m one of the lone sophomores who took this course (if any of you are upperclassmen thinking of taking it). It kinda sucks that you don&#x27;t know people and don&#x27;t have a pset buddy so I often lost points for silly errors, but I felt like I could do most of the psets by myself. Helproom is useful but it&#x27;s way too crowded to ask about just one question. It&#x27;s more overwhelming than asking at MQC for me personally so I tried to avoid it and ask my section TF instead.</td>

I had experience in chemistry so I though the first half of the semester was relatively easy. However, I didn&#x27;t have much biology experience so I struggled in the later half of the semester. But I really enjoyed learning these topics because I think it is super interesting.</td>

I never payed attention in lectures though. I got too distracted and rewatching the lectures in 2x speed in a quiet room with the notes opened helped a ton. don&#x27;t wait until the last minute though they can be 40ish mins long each even in 2x speed. Go to office hours with Joe (head TF) and if you have any questions about PSET or just a concept ask him he explains it very well. However, don&#x27;t ask him about lab questions. he is very smart and certified to answer, but the lab TF&#x27;s are looking for a specific answer on the lab report so just ask them. The most helpful thing that I did was reading the pre&ndash;lecture notes. the actual notes are okay but you can barely make sense of them. Go to section, and if you don&#x27;t finish the worksheet, they post the answers. I felt like I learned way more in section than I did in actual lecture. practice exams are way harder than actual exams so that&#x27;s good. if you don&#x27;t have a strong background in chem or bio you can still succeed in this class as long as you rewatch the lectures, read the pre&ndash;lectures, go to section, and go to office hours with JOE. dont bother asking a CA for help during office hours they may confuse you even more.</td>

The material is about half chemistry half biology so you get a taste of both, it is challenging but not overbearing, and you get some lab experience as well. There is a ridiculous amount of help available for people (like me) who struggle to keep up and need some extra support. The TFs and CAs are all awesome and very happy to help, the professors have a policy during lecture where you can just shout out a question if you don&#x27;t understand something, and there&#x27;s plenty of materials on Canvas to help as well. There are 3 lectures and a workshop every week so it does take a lot of room in your schedule, but there is only one PSET so not too much work outside of class if you pay attention during lecture. There are also 3 midterms so it does become quite a grind in the middle of the semester but if you stay on top of all the material and show up to the Practice Exam sessions you should be fine. Overall a great intro course full of lovely people!</td>

For context: I passed both AP Biology and AP Chemistry. To decide, I had a conversation with Prof. Amanda Spiewak, of the Chemistry and Chemical Biology Department. She was incredibly helpful in helping me make a decision. In short, she told me that LPSA would help me cover the bases of chemistry and biology all over again, to have those foundations strong for the rest of my Harvard undergraduate career. In contrast, LS1A would not so be an introductory course, but an introductory applications course, as this class covers not the theoretical aspects of biology and general chemistry, but their applications in introductory lights. <br/><br/>&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;<br/><br/>tl;dr: Both are really manageable if you have a background similar to mine, but I would recommend that, if you seek re&ndash;learning the foundations from a Harvard perspective, take LPSA! If you feel already confident and would like an introduction much more application&ndash;based, do LS1A.</td>
