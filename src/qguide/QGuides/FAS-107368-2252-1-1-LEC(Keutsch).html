It&#x27;s easy to keep up with if you&#x27;ve taken AP Chemistry and the midterm model (one drop including the final) is an absolute genius move. Try hard to do well on the midterms so you have one less final to take. A lot of my friends coming from LPSA were well versed in the structure of the course and the IMMENSE amount of support it provides but were coming from a little less of a chemistry background so struggled in that regard. That being said, the support this class gives is crazy; utilize it soon and often if you need.</td>

The concept review on the weekly section packets are really good to use on your cheat sheets because they&#x27;re basically a condensed version of the lectures. The section questions are also really good review for exams! Highly recommend Joe&#x27;s office hours. He is the sole reason, outside my section TF, for excelling in this class.  If you&#x27;re premed, you are likely taking this with LS1B (which is what the majority of your energy is likely going to be going to). So, save yourself the struggle by locking IN on midterms so you dont have to take the final for this course and can lock in for LS1B.</td>

There were lots of helpful preparation materials&#x2F;opportunities for exams, so all the tests felt very approachable and not scary. Discussion sections felt completely unnecessary and redundant, so I was a little annoyed with the mandatory attendance for it. But otherwise, this course is very reasonable, despite its lowkey obsession with attendance (which I don&#x27;t think is really necessary to succeed at all since so many learning resources are made available online by the PS11 team).</td>

Lectures are long and confusing and often do not really tell you what you need to know, but a good section leader is so helpful and the annotated slideshows they post were how I learned all the content.</td>

Lectures were unfocused, disjointed, and often wholly divorced from the actual course content. Psets were generally fair, although the &quot;50 globally relevant questions&quot; were ironically anything but relevant to the actual course content (just busywork). Similarly, the labs were of little relevance. Section and peer coaching were quite frankly the only useful aspects of this course. Ultimately, this is not a super hard course, per se, but rather just an unnecessarily time&ndash;consuming one, with some of the teaching staff seeming downright disrespectful of their students&#x27; well being and time. If only Gregg Tucci taught the whole course and the busywork assignments were removed, it would be so much better.</td>

They reflect what we learned in class and also a good reflection of the practice exam. There has never been a problem on the exam that we have not seen a variation of on the pset or on practice exams. As someone who was taking 6 classes during the semester, I didn&#x27;t put that much time in this class, but I still came out with a rudimentary understanding of chemistry and was not incredibly stressed. I think it is only stressful if you do things last minute. I have always started pset part I, the online portion, about 3 hrs before it&#x27;s due. A 90% gives you full credit, so don&#x27;t stress about making things perfect. There is a point of diminishing returns. Here is my work flow if you wish to have an understanding of the weekly workload: I start part II on Saturdays. I don&#x27;t do anything before then. I go to the 2 hrs office hours and then the additional office hours with Joe, who won&#x27;t be on the teaching staff next year, but I complete the most of the pset on Saturday. I leave Sunday and Monday for sometimes when the pset is longer than usual. This class really isn&#x27;t supposed to be rocket science, and people that say it is so, they just want to be perfect, and you can&#x27;t always have that. Find other things worth your time to be stressed about. You don&#x27;t have to be perfect to get an A. There are also plenty of opportunities to savage your pset and lab scores. <br/><br/>Lectures are fun. I enjoy Frank&#x27;s way of presentation. We go through the mathematics, and there are also fun demonstrations. You just need to buy into this class in order to enjoy this. I am speaking as someone who has taken chem 20 before taking this class. This class is much easier than any of the orgo classes, but the two classes are completely unrelated. It&#x27;s also more entertaining than any orgo class you will take. You don&#x27;t have to take this class before orgo. So, feel free to take this class when you are junior like me. And like don&#x27;t gatekeep. There is a mutual benefit with sharing and discussing answers. It&#x27;s never that serious that you must hide your answers from your peers. You are not pitted against your peers. This class is not curved, so don&#x27;t focus on strategizing against your classmates. There is always a bunch of people like that in every OH. Please do not be like those people.<br/><br/>You will do most of your practical learning with your section TF. Go Elena!! Best TF ever. She does a great overview of the topics and then goes through the problems with us instead of forcing us to attempt it on our own. She lets us do that if we have multiple problems that have a similar set up, but she understands that there is a limited amount of time to get through all the problems, and she rather go through all the problems with us then make us try to go through the solutions by ourselves. kween behavior. For exam studying tips, I highly suggest going over pset part II problems. Never bother with part I. Then go over Lu&#x27;s review study guides. Those videos are holy grails. If you don&#x27;t have time for the full videos, I highly suggest watching the sections of the videos where she goes through some examples if you think you have a good grasp of the basic. There are some unique examples that may benefit you on the exams. You get a cheat sheet front and back for each exam, so fill it up with things that she says. <br/><br/>My main gripe about this class is the wacky lab schedule. Like, this is genuinely my only issue with this class. It was genuinely so odd how there was an A  and B group. But then it wasn&#x27;t consistent? So then what was the point? The idea was that group A students go first, then group B goes the next week. But sometimes, we had both groups going each week. Friday&#x27;s section is the last to go for one lab, but for the next lab topic, they somehow become the first class to go. And then tell me why the prelab for the next lab is due before the lab report for the current lab. I think the Friday&#x27;s lab sections got screwed over the most this semester. And then for the weeks that Friday&#x27;s group goes last, every single group, no matter if you were monday&#x27;s lab from the week before or friday&#x27;s lab, everyone had the same due date. That&#x27;s simply not fair for people who only had the weekend to put together the lab report versus someone who has the whole week.</td>

To be transparent, I got very very lucky and had Ian as my section lead. This was his first year teaching and from the very first day I knew I was in great hands because he valued us conceptually understanding the topics above getting through the section questions (while still making sure we got through everything) and his genuine love for chemistry made it easy to take an interest in the material. Because of the fact I lucked out with my section lead, I&#x27;ll admit I gave up on lectures midway through the semester and I still did great in the class. Office hours are great for getting through the psets, I only ever went to the section lead ones not the instructor ones and I could usually get through most if not both psets (which was rgeat since I always left them to the last minute). From the syllabus the workload for this class may seem like a lot but it is very manageable ( if you&#x27;re taking it concurrently with LS1b its a huge help that their due dates are on different days of the week). <br/>Study early for the exams!!!!

YOU LEARN IN SECTION AND OFFICE HOURS. When doing the pests, have the weekly packet and the lectures correlating to that pset open: you will reference these frequently and it will save you time to have them open. Lu Wang problem solving videos are very helpful &ndash; you should ideally watch these before completing the problem set because they will teach you how to do the problems on the problem set. Joe and Morgan greats TFs, access them if you can. Think of lecture is a preview of what you are going to learn, but very hard to actually learn in lecture so focus on learning in section and then clarifying things in helproom. On this guide, you will read half of students saying everything is disorganized in this course and half saying it’s super organized: here is my take on this: The actual materials, timeline, etc. of the course is the most organized I’ve ever seen. You always know about all deadlines and details and all the materials you should ever need are organized well in canvas. The communication is frequent and detailed and the course is very structured. However, the actual lectures are very disorganized and hard to understand. This is where the disorganization frustration among students comes from.</td>

Before the first lecture on the first day of classes, we already needed to watch a lecture, scan and submit a few pages of work, and complete Pset 0 Part 2 (but not part 1 yet). If I had not checked canvas in the middle of January, a week before classes started, I would have already been several hours behind on the first day. This pattern continued throughout the semester, with several things being due each week, all at different times. At the beginning, the head TF explained that many people fall behind in this course, so they split each assignment up into sub&ndash;parts with multiple checkpoints per week, BUT this method actually had the reverse effect by making me more anxious about all the little due dates. For example, there is a Pset Part 1, Pset Part 2, Pre&ndash;lab, and Lab Report due each week but on four different days (and across Canvas, Gradescope, and EdX platforms), so I needed to re&ndash;allocate my time each week depending on which of those assignments were due when. What&#x27;s a simple solution to the scheduling problem? Create a class Gcal! Great idea. This course had a class Gcal that we were required to subscribe to as part of Pset 0 Part 2. HOWEVER, the Gcal was never updated and often contained outdated or flat&ndash;out incorrect information about due dates. Roughly once a week, I would need to email my section TF asking about the due dates for all these mini assignments because there could be up to THREE DIFFERENT dates given to us (Gcal says one day, Canvas calendar says another day, and the weekly PS11 newsletter says a third day). This course had several critical organizational issues that created unnecessary confusion for my peers and me. <br/><br/>In addition, the way that the gradescope submissions work, a student will upload a scanned document and the computer will automatically assign each problem to a specific part of each page. Most of the time this saves the student a few minutes of needing to manually assign each problem to a specific page. However, on multiple of my Psets, the computer would incorrectly assign one part of a page to a specific problem (it thinks that Problem 3 is in the middle of Page 4, but it is actually a few centimeters farther down based on how I scanned my pages) and I would automatically get a 0 on that problem. The computer put a little box around where it thinks the problem should be, instead of where it actually is on the page, and the result is the TF grading that problem is given an incomplete or non&ndash;existent portion of my work. Super frustrating because then my TF said &quot;sorry, there&#x27;s nothing we can do about this because the computer does that automatically&quot;. <br/><br/>Finally, many of the TF&#x27;s are clearly not excited about this course, or have no idea what&#x27;s going on. There were many times when I would be given an incorrect answer at office hours and then would need to go to office hours later that day to double check the first TF&#x27;s answers. Several times, they made me feel like I was a burden to double check answers, even though it is not my fault that a previous TF had point&ndash;blank told me an incorrect answer.</td>

To me, PS11 was the choice I made over the Chem 10&ndash;20 track. While I do not regret it at all, I do wish I had gotten to delve deeper into many subjects within chemistry. The course gives a nice overview of quantum chemistry, some elements of environmental chemistry, and thermodynamics. It is not much work, and the content is very easy to understand. Additionally, the practice tests are extremely representative of the exams, and you can learn most of the content (if you&#x27;ve missed any) right before the exams as well. The drop policy for exams (4 taken including final, only 3 counted) takes a lot of pressure off to do amazingly on every one. I did not take AP chem before this course, and I felt fine. However, I also took LPSA, which has a lot of the same course staff.</td>

Lecture attendance is mandatory yet lectures are not useful. Try your best to get something out of lecture, but do not freak out if you don&#x27;t understand much. Most of your learning will take place in office hours &ndash;&ndash; Joe is the absolute best, I&#x27;ve never met a better, more efficient teacher. The PSets are great at solidifying what you need to know on exams, start early, go to office hours, and make sure you get the pset material right the first time. Lab OH are not as great, they tend to be understaffed and I&#x27;ve had different TFs tell me differing answers&#x2F;help.  How helpful section is largely depends on who your section TF is... if you feel like you aren&#x27;t in a fruitful section, switch, it will make a huge difference. Exams are fair, but exam 2 is very long, so move quickly.  Your cheat sheet for each exam is a life saver... mostly just helps in reviewing what you need to know.  Don&#x27;t waste your time reading the textbook &ndash; not necessary and takes too much time. The problem&ndash;solving videos are great, watch them week by week before you start the pset if possible, and don&#x27;t wait to watch them until the exam time. Good luck!!</td>

What will be challenging in this class is the time management aspect. There are three lectures and a section each week, as well as a lab most weeks. There are two psets, a pre&ndash;lab, and a lab report due every week. It is best to get on a regular weekly schedule to complete all of these, because if not, you will likely end up doing much of it at the last minute and be unnecessarily stressed. That being said, because of this high volume there are also a number of opportunities for extra credit, pset drops, etc. Take advantage of all of these — your grade will benefit and it will make each assignment a little bit lower stakes. It will give you a bit of wiggle room for those weeks when everything piles up and you can’t manage to get the pset done. Finally, try your best to do well on the midterms so that you don’t have to take the final — this will reduce your finals season stress substantially.</td>

Even the important stuff was explained kind of oddly. As a result, your section TF really makes or breaks your experience in the course, since that&#x27;s where all the concepts start to make sense. I had Ian, and he was amazing — I don&#x27;t know if he&#x27;s TFing next year, but if he is, I would 100% try to get into his sections or go to his office hours because he&#x27;s super willing to help and great at explaining.

Two problem sets a week is a lot, especially if you are taking other problem set courses at the same time. I took PS11 along with LS1b and a math course. The trio is doable, albeit exhausting. Make sure to time manage well and stay on top of concepts. If you took LPSA in the fall, the chemistry portion will help A LOT with this class. I highly recommend finding a problem set buddy and going to help room for part two of the problem set. The course assistants in this course are god&ndash;sends and will walk you through problems. This is necessary given the disaster that is lecture. Frank is the primary lecturer and fails to explain concepts. He will spend majority of the lecture deriving equations, despite students receiving an equation sheet with the deprived equations on the exam. If you are lost in lecture, do not worry. The main learning in this course happens when completing problem sets and studying for exams. I found the midterms to be very fair and often easier than the practice exams.  In addition to receiving an equation sheet on exams, you also get to bring in a double&ndash;sided cheat sheet. The best part of this course is that the final is optional, if you do well on the three midterms. This course is a lot but you will eventually fall into a routine. You got this :)</td>

I highly highly highly recommend going to his OH the night before the exams because he often gives tips that will help you on the exam. ALSO GET ON HIS EMAIL LIST.

The exams didn&#x27;t overlap too much (besides 1 was back to back), but you do either have a PIE or midterm every single week, which is hard, but I think PS11 is best to get over with, and I know juniors who regret waiting to take it.

This class will feel like it&#x27;s giving a lot of busy work, but there are two important points to consider here. First, it&#x27;s not really busy work — everything they make you do in this class (maybe with the exception of some labs, which felt a bit irrelevant) will help solidify your understanding of the material. Second, it doesn&#x27;t actually take that long if you manage your time well. My advice would be to definitely attend help rooms (office hours) when you have questions.  <br/><br/>Also, Frank is an incredibly knowledgeable scholar, but in my opinion, he should not be teaching this class. Frank knows so much about this content that he will often get ahead into concepts that are too complicated for the scope of this class and that causes him to focus less on actually explaining important concepts. This is just something to be aware of when you take this class because you may need to do a lot of your learning either on your own, in section, or in help room. Aside from that, the class is incredibly well organized and there is always a lot of support available (much more than in LS1b, and I&#x27;m comparing the two because students often take these classes together in one semester).</td>

LOCK IN FOR YOUR MIDTERMS because then you get to skip the final. <br/>2. Just do all the practice exams and make sure you understand them. They are basically the same as the actual exam. <br/>3. Lectures for 400+ people are not super engaging, so if you don&#x27;t learn best through lectures, just make sure you listen in section and can do the pset questions. <br/>4. People complain too much (as a way to trauma bond as pre&ndash;meds). PS11 is actually a good class (especially if you have a wonderful TF, like Morgan!).</td>

If you have taken AP Chemistry, much of the material will be review but some new topics and skills will be introduced. I am an intended pre&ndash;med chemistry concentrator, and so this course was pretty much unavoidable for completing my general chemistry requirement, The course content is pretty manageable, and the assignments are not too hard, just long and numerous. It is not my favorite course I have taken here, but not the worst either.</td>

However, with enough effort and dedication you can do extremely well in this class and leave with much knowledge gained. Many will say that lecture is useless and while Frank is a great person I will agree he&#x27;s not the most effective lecturer. There are many tangents and a lot is thrown at you at once however to succeed, ask questions about everything! Will be ending this class with an A (at worst A&ndash;), and my key to success was staying after lecture to clarify concepts with the instructors during helproom and also paying attention in section. The TFs and instructors truly want you to succeed so if you utilize the resources its definitely possible. Labs are boring but easy. The exams are fair and practice exams prepare you well. Go to helproom to finish your Psets to ensure you get full points. Good luck STEM baddies.</td>

Lectures are boring and often unrelated to psets and exams. There are two psets a week, sometimes more than ten pages long. I would spend ages on the psets and still be confused ever after going to helproom. Exams were stressful and high&ndash;stakes. For an introductory science class I feel it does more to dissuade people from science than encourage them to pursue it.</td>

For context, I’m an ESPP concentrator who hasn’t taken chemistry since sophomore year of high school during COVID, so I was a bit nervous about my preparation for the course. Honestly, I didn’t feel as though I was behind once the course started. There are review videos for concepts you should be familiar with already. <br/><br/>Truthfully, PS11 was the one requirement for ESPP that I really didn’t want to do. Like REALLY did not want to. BUT I actually kind of enjoyed PS11. Taking a chemistry course was not something I anticipated, but I gained a strong foundation in chemistry principles and their connections to energy and the environment, which I found super interesting. The assignments can be a lot, and the workload is no joke. Lecture 3x a week plus a section and sometimes lab a lot of class time &ndash; PLUS pset part I every week, pset part II every week, prelabs, and lab reports. However, all of these are less daunting than they seem, and as long as you don’t leave everything for the last minute, it’s surely manageable. But expect to dedicate a decent chunk of time to this course. If you do, you can do well. The exams can be tough, but they are also manageable, and it was nice knowing that I could drop an exam if needed (they only count 3 out of 4 exams).<br/><br/>I will say, the lectures can be a bit dry, and I did not find my section leader engaging. This course is much better if you have some friends in it, but I’m sure you can also meet people who are looking for friends in the class. Overall, I’m leaving PS11 with a much greater perception than I had going in, and in a way, I am glad that the ESPP requirement forced me to take this class.</td>

The content is super interesting and they make an effort to connect it to real&ndash;world topics like climate change. Also, it is amazing that you have the option of not taking the final exam if you do well on the three midterms!!! The PSETs can get long but they are relatively straightforward. I would say the exams are also straightforward because they are really similar to class materials and do not try to trick you. The professors are super nice, approachable, and patient (and sometimes gives us a good laugh during lectures). Overall, I really enjoyed this class!</td>

While the content isn&#x27;t necessarily super super difficult, the psets are super long and there are a lot of assignments in general (psets part 1 and 2, pre lab assignments, lab reports, etc.) But, if you put in the work to do all the assignments and spend time outside of lecture trying to understand the concepts, you will do well. The exams are pretty fair and the grading is fair too. The bad thing is that you have 3 midterms and a final, but the good thing is that only 3 out of your 4 scores count&ndash; so if you&#x27;re happy with your three midterm scores then you can just not take the final. <br/><br/>Also, PS11 does cover some unexpected topics in the course. The first few weeks might feel more like physics instead of chemistry, but it does get to be more conventional chem later.</td>

Taking this with LS1b is not as bad as everyone makes it out to be. One piece of advice is to grind for the three midterms so you don&#x27;t have to take the final! The midterms are so easy and the practice exams are very representative of what they are going to be. It is so worth it to work hard throughout the year and will make finals season so much better.</td>
