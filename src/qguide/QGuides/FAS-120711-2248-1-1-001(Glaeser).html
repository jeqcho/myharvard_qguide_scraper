But boy was I wrong about the relative difficulty. I thought that Ec1011 would be mind&ndash;boggling hard and Stat110 would be a walk in the park but I could not be more wrong. I thought that Stat110 was a much harder course than Ec1011 for a couple of reasons: (1) Stat has a wide distribution of student abilities so some people get 95 or 100s on the tests, while others get 40s and this means it is much harder to get a good grade as you need to compete relatively against some strong classmates. However in Ec1011, everyone, no matter how much of a math genius they are, does poorly on the test (around a 50 with a tight SD) so if you are just average like me, you won’t suffer under the intelligence of your smarter peers. (2) Ec1011 is just multivariable calculus and taking derivatives which is much more algorithmic (and you have practice in HS), so the math can be messy but it is not extraordinarily difficult. Also the economic logic taught in the course is very self&ndash;intuitive, so you can generally know a sensible answer to the question.  However with Stat, it is much more about logical, creative problem solving akin to competition math problems which was harder for me (and many others) as you’re not taught in high school how to solve math problems creatively and find a neat trick that makes the problem a lot easier. I found that Ec was more manageable as everyone is similarly lost together in lecture and the class, while in Stat everyone is expected to understand the material, so if you take both classes at the same time, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND SPENDING MORE TIME ON STAT — your grade in Econ will only improve by so much and you can take the time to study the material around the midterm and final when Aakaash’s review sections give you a good sense of what will be on the test. Spend the much more important weekly time on getting started on the Stat psets early and building your problem solving skills there. <br/><br/><br/>EC1011a vs. Ec1010a <br/>For those on the fence, I would highly recommend taking Ec1011a over 1010. <br/><br/>(1) In 1011, a majority of the students get an A&ndash; or above as the curve is now more lenient than it used to be (coming from Prof. Glaeser himself) as it needs to more closely match the 1010 grade distribution. I think college is about taking classes that will challenge you and where you will learn a lot (1011), rather than taking a sleepy class where you can coast by and not get the full Harvard experience (1010), so I implore you to ponder about whether you want to make your college experience rewarding and intellectually stimulating or coast by in boredom&#x2F;ambivalence and wonder why you spend so much money to take boring classes.  <br/><br/>(2) The material and skills you learn in 1011 are MUCH MORE satisfying than in 1010. In 1011, you understand and appreciate the importance of modeling in economics and it introduces key concepts like insurance, moral hazard, intertemporal consumption, and monopolies in a much more interesting manner. <br/><br/>(3) Professor Glaeser is an incredibly accomplished professor, and despite the fact that he lectures at an incredibly fast pace and takes partials at the speed of light, it felt like taking use of Harvard’s resources to hear from a potential future Nobel laureate. His theory on spatial equilibrium and special topics on the economics of crime, hatred and cities are eye&ndash;opening and reveal why microeconomics is such an interesting topic and the variety of ways it can be applied. <br/><br/>(4) The first couple weeks of 1011 are designed to scare people off and they are actually the toughest in the course (it gets easier from there). The math before the midterm is really messy and scary, but after the midterm the topics become more interesting, the math is simpler and people are just tired of doing crazy math, so it gets easier from there. If you can survive the early rough patches, you will be in for a great course. <br/><br/><br/>Tips to succeed in the course <br/><br/>1. Read&#x2F;Gloss over ALL the lecture slides before Ed’s lectures. He speeds through material at a speed of light in lecture and even the most smart math people I know couldn’t keep up pace sometimes with how fast he took derivatives. Reading through the lecture slides in advance to understand how he set up a model or does the math will be great so that in class you can just focus on understanding the economic intuition that is much more valuable to grasp in this course. <br/>2. Go to office hours to do psets. The psets (at least in the beginning) are mathematically intense so showing up to office hours and doing them under the guidance of the CA are useful so you aren’t led astray. Also the wording can be confusing and vague so great to get their advice about what the question is aksing you to solve. <br/>3. Psets are graded on completion — if you are hacking away at math and can’t quite get the right answer just move on. As long as you do&#x2F;attempt 75% of the pset and spend a good 5 hours, you will come away with full marks so don’t stress<br/>4. Attend Aakaash’s review section. These are incredible useful not only when it comes to studying for the midterm&#x2F;finals, but also for reviewing the weekly lecture material as he draws on it for TFUs and questions on the exams. <br/>5. Understand that you will only understand 50% of Ed’s lectures. He breezes by lecture content as he is very smart and there is a ton of material packed in, so know that you are not alone in barely being able to follow with his lectures <br/>6. Go into the lecture with a goal of understanding the intuition and not the math. The intuition is very important in this course — that’s what the tests generally test you on, and the math can be secondary to that. No one will really understand the math on your first go, but you always have the time to review the slides and ask the course staff later about math questions. But Ed doesn’t record lecture and can breeze through the logic of the all&ndash;important economic intuition so focus on that.</td>

The smartest, most mathematically and economically minded students in this college struggle in this course. That said, you will come away from it with a much deeper understanding of economics and the math behind it, and you will know what it is like to work through a truly brutal class (in a good way!).</td>

			<td class="TabularBody_LeftColumn" headers="comment-2_8fb3724e-6302-4a98-8be9-03a0b095cfb3">I would very strongly recommend taking this class over 1010a. If you are considering 1011a seriously enough to be looking at this Q guide, you should absolutely take 1011. It is far less work for far more reward. Although Professor Glaeser is difficult to follow at times, none of the material is so outrageously difficult that you can&#x27;t figure it out before the exam. The teaching team is excellent and the policy discussions at the beginning of lecture made this the most interesting course I&#x27;ve taken at Harvard. Don&#x27;t be spooked by the algebra and notation during the first few lectures, it really is not as bad as it looks.</td>

			<td class="TabularBody_LeftColumn" headers="comment-2_8fb3724e-6302-4a98-8be9-03a0b095cfb3">Think hard before taking this class. Took this class for Am&#x2F;ec requirement but definitely would have take 1010 in hindsight. Undeniably learned a lot from the class, but the class expects a lot of dedication from students. The math can often dilute the economic intuition that you need to know, and the lectures gloss over the math quickly. But the lectures were definitely the highlight of this class, and Ed Glaeser is probably one of the smartest people I’ve met and one of the forefront urban economist. You really have to put 100% effort to excel, or even stay afloat, in this class. The modeling projects, midterm, and final are difficult to get a good score on, despite a crazy curve at the end. If you’re just going for finance or trying to get a deeper sense of economics, I’m not sure if you would maximize your utility by taking this class.</td>

I was amazed by how we used math to study everything, from the insurance and climate change, to things like voting, crime, and even modeling hatred as a political tool. Ed&#x27;s policy discussions were so insightful and I liked that he often interacted with the audience to gauge our opinions on the topic as well. The problems are also rather fun and exciting once you get into them. <br/>The problem sets are definitely very difficult, but manageable if you start early and go to several office hours. The first few questions are usually manageable just with the material learned from class, while for the final questions some insight from OH might be necessary. Luckily, I was able to meet the most amazing TFs who explained everything to me so clearly, and more importantly, gave me confidence in the material! Though the psets are completion&ndash;based, it is much better to do them because they are a valuable resource to look back on in case you forgot how to do a particular thing. <br/>The exams were extremely hard with extremely low averages, but with equally extreme curves. Don&#x27;t expect to finish every single question &ndash; it&#x27;s impossible. Focus on getting a solid understanding and economic intuition for the True&#x2F;False&#x2F;Uncertain questions &ndash; they add a lot of points to your grade. Akaash was instrumental in my preparation for the final, and explained everything very manageably, which gave me more confidence in the material. <br/>All in all, take this class if you love economics &ndash; the course will make you love it more. But you still need to work very hard!!</td>

The section leaders and TF Aakaash are always willing to help you and want you to succeed. My biggest tip would be to form study &#x2F; PSET groups early and make sure you understand the reasoning behind why you are setting up each math model (on the PSETs and modeling projects). Stay on top of each section and make sure to go to office hours as soon as you are confused.

Prof. Glaeser is a great lecturer, and the course staff was amazing. In my opinion, the assignments were over the top in terms of difficulty. Thankfully the problem sets are just check&#x2F;check&ndash;minus, but the exams (especially the midterm) were ridiculously hard.</td>

If you feel yourself falling behind, take ~1 hour at the end of each week just to catch up on material. The concepts are not difficult to understand, but you need to give yourself a strong foundation so you can practice application problems more readily. <br/><br/>Some advice: <br/><br/>Problem sets: Do them. Even if you just aim for the check when you initially submit, go back and try to do the problems to entirety, or at least watch the solution walk through.<br/>Modeling projects: These are very difficult. However, essentially everyone gets the same grade so don&#x27;t stress too much. If you think you&#x27;ll test poorly maybe try a little harder, but don&#x27;t stress too much.<br/>Exams: These are very difficult, but much easier if you stay on top of the material each week instead of cramming. Then, when it comes to exam time, you are at least familiar with the economic intuition and can instead spend your time doing practice problems. GO TO THE EXAM REVIEW SESSIONS!!<br/><br/>If you go to section, especially Aakaash&#x27;s, you will be fine. The hardest part about this course is trying not to compare yourself with the Math 55ers who take this for fun. However, what goes a long way (especially on grading) is truly understanding the economic intuition, not solving the math. Would highly recommend taking this course, even if you have little to no background in anything related. It is extremely interesting and fulfilling, and the first time I have felt a true return on my investment in a class at Harvard. Don&#x27;t let the impostor syndrome get to you and give yourself the chance to learn something new and challenging!</td>

Professor Glaeser is a dynamic lecturer who never fails to make class interesting while still explaining all content in full (though don&#x27;t try to read his handwriting), and the policy discussions at the start of each class have legit changed my life (time&ndash;inconsistent preferences explain so much about procrastination). The Head TF, Aakaash Rao, is by far the best TF (and perhaps even the best teacher in general) I&#x27;ve ever encountered, and his weekly sections (GO TO THEM) perfectly fill in all the gaps from lecture. I&#x27;ve heard he might not be coming back next year, which would be a huge loss for the course. The CA&#x27;s are also great; they explain things well, their sections are actually helpful, and are generally just nice people. The worst CA in Econ 1011a is better than the best CA I&#x27;ve encountered in any of my other classes this semester.<br/><br/>Although Econ 1011a is a *lot* of work, all that work is worth it. Completing the PSets actually helped my understanding and wasn&#x27;t just busywork, and the Modeling Projects, though very hard and very, very long, were a very cool window into what being an economist actually looks like.  There&#x27;s also a lot of help out there if you are struggling with a topic; watch the math explainer videos (which you should be doing anyway), read one of the CA&ndash;written textbooks (which you should be doing anyway), and go to office hours (which you should be doing anyway).<br/><br/><br/>Also, you *need* to be comfortable with multi before taking this course. In addition, Professor Glaeser claims you don&#x27;t need any previous econ experience. This is true, but misleading. You don&#x27;t *need* previous econ experience, but you better have good economic intuition skills (e.g. &quot;Without any numbers reason through what happens when a minimum wage law is imposed on a monopsonist. Is such a law justified (economically)?&quot;)—I had that already developed that economic intuition and my life was a lot easier as a result.</td>

That said, I have a few paragraphs of critiques. <br/><br/>Ed Glaeser&#x27;s goal with this course is not principally to teach you economics. It is to convince Harvard&#x27;s most intelligent math students that economics is sufficiently challenging for them to pursue a PhD in it. He does not care if you are totally lost, falling beyond, or confused. When he lectures, he is talking to the 5&ndash;10 students who he knows are following. This can be extremely frustrating if you are someone who is truly interested in the subject matter but isn&#x27;t fluent in gibberish. As part of this goal, it often feels like the lectures are there to impress people, rather than teach them.<br/><br/>The section leaders for this course seemed to be selected based on the criteria of &quot;similarity to Ed Glaeser,&quot; which does not exactly lend itself to being a good supplement. Aakash is of course the exception; he is an incredible instructor.<br/><br/>The modeling projects were&ndash;&ndash;to be honest&ndash;&ndash;very fun. However, the 2nd one was kind of a mess. The walkthrough was very disappointing because the simplifying assumptions they made seemed so strong that the model did not really say anything about the real world. Grading on the modeling projects was very weird too because there was no rubric and no feedback.....<br/><br/>EXAMS. Glaeser believes a 45% mean is optimal to maximize the spread of scores. This is just not at all true. The exams did not do a good job of testing understanding because there was too much content, not enough time, and arbitrarily given partial credit. <br/><br/>These critiques are all very harsh and I hope the course fixes some of these flaws because there is no way the teaching staff does not know about them. <br/><br/>To be clear, as I said, this is the best course I&#x27;ve ever taken in my life. One way to read this feedback is that the good parts of this course were so incredible that they not only offset the major flaws, but made this course a net positive. Specifically, this course will change how you see the world. It will change how you make decisions in your everyday life. It will change how you (or if you) vote. It will change how you solve problems. It will make you a better conversationalist. It will inspire you to consider a career in academic research. It will give you a vocabulary for various intuitions you have always had about life. PLEASE take this course despite its flaws.</td>

If you work hard, then your grade will be okay as there is a generous curve, but the confidence blow of getting in the 30%s on the midterm is tough. However, in my opinion, this is a much more worthwhile class than 1010 given the policy discussions and breadth of material. My background was Math 21a&#x2F;b and 101 and Stat110 concurrently, which was on the lighter side in terms of relevant coursework prep.</td>

This course has very limited resources outside of the class. It doesn&#x27;t even have a proper book that you can refer to. Some of the past TFs worked on it during COVID, but it is still incomplete. <br/><br/>Also, the CAs are college students who often had hard time taking this course.

He has so much interesting stuff to say and is genuinely one of the smartest people I have encountered at Harvard. Aakash (the TF) is also great and balances quite well with Ed because he is much better at slowing down and explaining the math. The PSETs are hard and you can technically not try that hard because the grading is completion&ndash;based, but you definitely should try hard on them so that you keep up with the content. The exams are really hard, but if you go to Aakash&#x27;s review sessions and trust the curve, you will be ok.

All you do the entire semester is take the derivative(s) of some terrible function (often of more than one variable), and then set it or them equal to zero. The algebra to do so will be horrifically disgusting; it seems to be that Glaeser and the teaching staff intentionally make it so. <br/><br/>During the first lecture, he&#x27;ll talk a bunch about how this is a super hard class (something like &quot;there is Ec1010a, but this is HARVARD, and you deserve to have an econ class that challenges you&quot;). And this is the issue—they want this class to be infamous like Math 55 or Physics 16, but the material is just taking first derivatives. So they make it artificially difficult, with ridiculous algebra, tests that generate perfect bell curves around 50 (or less), and incredibly strict deadlines. Glaeser explicitly instructs the teaching staff not to help you on the three modelling projects. You also receive almost no feedback on those but a number out of ten on Canvas, so what do you learn from them? <br/><br/>The answer is more generally true of the class, and it is that you learn almost nothing at all. A student who is comfortable with taking a derivative with a couple chain rules in it and doing some algebra should be able to do 80% of the questions in this class on day one, provided they are given the definitions of a couple words used. What&#x27;s missing is economics—sometimes they&#x27;ll mention an interesting theorem, but one second later we continue differentiating!<br/><br/>The PSets, especially at the start of the year, are disgusting. To type up nice solutions and have all the algebra correct would probably take like six hours a week. But fortunately they grade them out of 2 points, and I don&#x27;t even know how bad your solutions would have to be to get a 1, so you can speedrun them and turn in a messy piece of paper with none of the calculations done correctly (for your own sake, do them this way, and not the high&ndash;effort way. But also for your own sake do not take this class). The modeling projects take far, far longer and can become algebraically horrible as well depending on what functions you choose. The first two of these are group projects; choose your partner(s) wisely. Our midterm was impossible to finish in 75 minutes and the average was in the 40s, so it was literally just a derivative speed contest. The final was quite a bit easier and could barely be finished in the allotted time if you knew what you were doing. Seems like the most common overall grade in the class by far is an A&ndash;, and maybe like 15% each B&ndash; and A, but I&#x27;m not sure.<br/><br/>But much of the above information should not concern you too much, because you should not take this class. Maybe you kind of have to if you want to do an Econ PhD, but even then, there has to be a better way—perhaps the graduate equivalent is better.</td>

I took this course because I&#x27;m doing AM&#x2F;Ec and basically had to. I think you&#x27;re now allowed to take EC 1010A instead of this, but I would honestly still recommend just going for EC 1011A. It looks much better on a transcript (if you&#x27;re recruiting for finance, applying to grad school, etc.) and the vast vast majority of people end up with an A&ndash;. From what I&#x27;ve heard, you can easily take 1010 and end up with a worse grade. Many aspects of this course will be very painful, but I think it&#x27;s genuinely character&ndash;building. I can&#x27;t say for sure, but I think from now on I&#x27;ll never take a course and find it absolutely impossible to do again. It really teaches you about the grind. <br/><br/>Here&#x27;s my take on different aspects of this course:<br/><br/>&ndash; Lectures: These are not that useful. The econ sweats in this class will worship Ed Glaeser like a god. I&#x27;m sure he&#x27;s very good at economics and much smarter than me, but the problem is he thinks this too, which makes him an ineffective lecturer. You will spend most of class confused. You will look back through your lecture notes and stay confused. If you aren&#x27;t willing to dedicate 3&ndash;4 hours after each lecture just going through the slides and doing all the derivations yourself and thinking about the intuitions, you will likely never get unconfused about lectures. I stopped attending around 1&#x2F;4 of the way through the course, and I still did extremely well on the midterm (not sure about the final yet, we&#x27;ll see how that goes). I think your time learning the course is much better spent elsewhere.<br/><br/>&ndash; Assignments: I found these to be pretty helpful for learning the content. The textbook  and course videos are really quite good. Force yourself to lock in every time a new topic rolls around, read the textbook chapter and watch every corresponding video, take notes, and you should end up with a good grasp on the most important parts of the content. The psets were pretty good at forcing you to try and apply the new content every week. You probably won&#x27;t have time to do everything and get it write and finish every derivation, etc., but luckily you don&#x27;t have to. They grade psets check&#x2F;check&ndash;minus&#x2F;0, and they don&#x27;t lie when they say they hand out checks very leniently. My advice is to do as much that you have time for, and then write at least something down for every remaining problem. But if you have other pset classes, definitely prioritize the psets for those.<br/><br/>&ndash; Section: Rishi&#x27;s section was excellent!! Don&#x27;t know if he&#x27;s CAing again though. I&#x27;ve been to other sections too on weeks where I couldn&#x27;t make my regular section, and I would say the quality of the sections REALLY depends on who your CA is. Although I remember they were not flexible at all about switching your section, so this really just comes down to your luck. <br/><br/>&ndash; Modeling Projects: These suck. Three modeling projects later, I&#x27;m still not super sure how to do well on them and what determines the grade you get. I&#x27;ve read the projects of friends who&#x27;ve gotten really good&#x2F;really bad grades on these after they were handed back, and the differences honestly seemed very minute (i.e. one extra line of intuition that they really liked could get someone a 95, missing one assumption for your model can put you at a 60). Luckily none of the modeling projects are worth that much percentage&ndash;wise, and most people seem to receive around the same grade on these, so just try your best and you&#x27;ll (hopefully) end up fine. <br/><br/>&ndash; EXAMS!!!:  If I end up doing well on this course it purely comes down to the exams. This strategy REALLY worked for me on the midterm. For context, when I started studying, I barely understood what was going on in the course. Even after studying, I definitely didn&#x27;t know more about micro&#x2F;the content of the course then the around 30% of the class who live and breathe economics. If this is going to be you, here&#x27;s my advice. Don&#x27;t think of the exam like a normal exam. The point is not to understand the course content better. The way to beat the median by a lot is to think of the exam as a game where you have to pick up as many points as possible. There are two ways to do this. First, attend Aakaash&#x27;s section. He revealed probably 3 TFU questions on the midterm (you only need to answer 4) and that really clutched up my grade. Second, instead of grinding all the practice exams, what I found much more helpful was drawing up a pure concepts memorization quiz for myself. I memorized literally every single formula and the optimized form of the most common functional forms (Cobb&ndash;Douglas, etc.). Obviously this was all crammed and forgotten immediately. But it really really came in clutch on the exams. Under the time constraints, no one will have time to solve every problem. Most people will not have time to solve most problems. You definitely do not have time to understand the economics and do all the derivatives calculations stuff unless you&#x27;re a math&#x2F;econ god. Memorizing everything allowed me to just write down the answers to most problems immediately and then add some intuitions. Memorize everything and then use the practice exams to gain pattern recognition of when to use what result you memorized. Honestly you don&#x27;t learn that many different things in this class so this is doable, a lot of class and section time is used proving things and doing math to get to the results, which you don&#x27;t need to know to score well on the exam. Studying this way is obviously very painful and perhaps not the most useful in actually understanding economics. But grades&ndash;wise, it will pay off.</td>

			<td class="TabularBody_LeftColumn" headers="comment-2_8fb3724e-6302-4a98-8be9-03a0b095cfb3">This class is amazing and by far the most rewarding class I&#x27;ve taken here at Harvard. But, please beware that people are not joking when they say this is one of the most rigorous classes that exist. As an econ major who had the option of taking 1010a, I enrolled in this class my reasons being: I wanted to take a class that would show me a glimpse into what economists really do and what an econ PhD would look like, I heard Professor Glaeser was phenomenal, and I wanted to challenge myself (in a way that few other undergrad econ classes at Harvard really do). And in the end, I did get all of these things but BIG emphasis on the getting challenged part. This class was a rollercoaster. If you are normal, you will likely not understand what is going on during lecture because of how fast the professor talks and how the most insane math is just skimmed over and basically recited to you at 2x speed. As someone who only came in with knowledge in multivariable calculus, it always felt like I was one step behind when everyone else around me had taken Stat 110, linear algebra, and&#x2F;or Math 25&#x2F;55. It is very very stressful. If you&#x27;re looking for a smoother ride towards getting an A, take 1010a. BUT, if you are passionate enough about economics and willing to put in the work and mental effort, this class is 100% worth it. I don&#x27;t regret my decision to take this class at all. Will you be confused 99% of the time? Yes. But that 1% of the time when you feel you&#x27;ve really grasped a concept or answered a problem on your own correctly or feel good about a modeling project makes it SO worth it. Also just making it the through the class and finishing, when 20 people usually drop within the first 2 weeks, is such a huge accomplishment and you will feel so good when you tell yourself that you made it in the end.  Also, if you do take the class and you are feeling bad about not getting things at first, every single concept in this class is super complex and sometimes you need to let the content marinate in your brain before you can really absorb them. You will have to read and re&ndash;read the textbook and lecture notes multiple times over the course of the semester before you actually get them. Don&#x27;t feel bad if you feel like everyone else is speeding past you. In reality, everybody is confused and doesn&#x27;t know what they&#x27;re doing but that&#x27;s really what makes everyone learn so much. Also, don&#x27;t let the super hard math cloud what the class is truly trying to teach you which is the economic intuition. It does take some insane algebra and calculus to get to the correct answers, but focus just as much energy on trying to understand the economics conceptually. On exams, demonstrating understanding of the intuition and concepts is valued more than just being able to crank out math. Practice the math A LOT but at the same time remember that that&#x27;s just a tool to get you the economic answers. So don&#x27;t get too discouraged if you feel like your math is not that strong. You will struggle but math shouldn&#x27;t be an obstacle for you to take the class. Lastly, both Professor Glaeser and the TFs (shoutout Aakaash) are all absolutely brilliant and definitely some of those brilliant people to exist in the economics world of academia. So the opportunity to learn from them is not something you would want to pass up. Though, take all of this with a grain of salt. If you are a math genius, you will probably find this class to be easier than I did. If you do take 1010a, that&#x27;s also great; you aren&#x27;t missing out on like a once in a lifetime opportunity. But if you get excited about economics, think math is kind of cool, and wanna challenge yourself, try it out.</td>

Problem sets are super chill and you&#x27;ll be fine on the modeling projects if you actually care and put in the effort to do a decent jobs. You won&#x27;t really receive feedback on them which will be annoying, but your grades will probably be decent on them.<br/><br/>The exams. They are hard. Like, really hard. They&#x27;re a bit difficult to prepare for and the time pressure is insane. Don&#x27;t make the mistake I did and GO TO AAKAASH&#x27;S (or whoever the head TF will be) SECTIONS each week. They will actually keep you up to date on material. Don&#x27;t spend too long on TFUs on the exam, the grading can be fickle and you&#x27;ll need time for the rest of it. Professor Glaeser is absolutely brilliant, but his lectures go really fast, almost to the point where they aren&#x27;t helpful. The policy discussions are fun and interesting though, so I&#x27;d still recommend attending. The exams can be frusturating which has left me feeling a bit sour about the course, but I have to say that this class did change how I think about the world. I really have noticed myself thinking about how different aspects of the world could be modeled with the economic tools we learned about and I feel grateful to have developed that perspective.</td>

I also really enjoyed the modeling projects. It was my first rewarding group project experience at Harvard. I was nervous coming into the class without any friends, but I met some really cool people and got to know them through the group work. Unfortunately, feedback on the psets and projects was very limited, but there are some good resources, such as the CA lecture notes and Aakash&#x27;s review sessions (idk if he&#x27;ll still TA next year though). The course was very challenging, but absolutely doable if you&#x27;ve taken multi before (prior economics experience is helpful but not necessary).</td>

Ed Glaeser is a legend, the graduate TFs are competent and passionate about economics, and the course is like a well&ndash;oiled machine. You really don&#x27;t have to worry about course logistics and can just dive into the material, which is quite interesting in its own right. <br/><br/>If you feel decently confident in your math skills (especially multivariate calc), and you want to learn what economics is about, just take this class over the ECON 10 &#x2F; ECON 1010 series. You learn much more and this automatically catapults you into a quantitative way of economic thinking, instead of getting a &quot;watered&ndash;down version of economics&quot; (not my words, but I agree strongly). This was my first ECON class (as an upperclassman) and I felt sufficiently challenged yet quite comfortable in the class. <br/><br/>For those who end up taking this class, Ed moves fast, but one quickly learns how to absorb the overall point of each lecture, and Ed also does a great job of summarizing the content in the final three minutes of each lecture. The exams are tough but fair. Modeling projects are fun and allow you to explore economics in a creative way, but don&#x27;t overcomplicate them too much from the start. The first one is the hardest, then it really does get easier after that. Problem sets can be annoyingly bashy and algebra&ndash;heavy, but they are completion&ndash;based, so learn how to do just enough algebra to give a half&ndash;decent answer. You shouldn&#x27;t be spending more than 6 hours on a p&ndash;set.  <br/><br/>Godspeed. May the marginal benefit you gain from taking this class be greater than the marginal cost.</td>

			<td class="TabularBody_LeftColumn" headers="comment-2_8fb3724e-6302-4a98-8be9-03a0b095cfb3">Be very careful about taking this class; it will take a lot out of you and make you question many of your life choices. But maybe that&#x27;s what makes the class so great: it doesn&#x27;t hide the brutal reality of graduate&ndash;level economics from overly ambitious undergrads (e.g. me). I&#x27;ll try to give my best overview of the course structure to help paint a picture of what taking this course will be like.<br/><br/>1011A is notorious for being one of the most difficult undergrad intermediate micro courses in the country, and for good reason. The class is taught at a high level of rigor and moves very quickly; as everyone else will say, Ed goes far too fast in lecture when doing derivations on the board. Psets are also quite tedious to complete, though they are graded for completion. Policy discussions are often interesting and take up the first 15 or 20 minutes of lecture. Use them as a chance to understand why we&#x27;re learning the topic of the day, as the math that ensues will probably not make much sense to you. The professor, Ed, is not accessible outside of class (other than a mandatory pizza lunch you have to go to for a grade). The head TF Aakash writes the exams and modeling projects. There&#x27;s also a head CA who runs the administrative work for the class (such as Ed). Finally, there are the CAs who run section&#x2F;OH&#x2F;grading. Section is mandatory each week, where you will go over concepts from that week and do practice problems. Office hours are probably not helpful (they&#x27;re told to provide very little guidance, especially on the modeling projects, and since the psets are completion it&#x27;s really not even worth going, you can just read the solutions or watch the walkthrough after if you&#x27;re curious).<br/><br/>In terms of preparation, multivariable calculus at the level of Math 21A&#x2F;22B is necessary. However, it is probably insufficient: stopping at this level will probably lead to you falling behind as you try to unwrangle the math (though mostly just tedious algebra, partial derivatives aren&#x27;t terribly complicated). As a 22B alum, I found myself losing all the intuition as I tried to grasp the math. Those who took Math 25 or 55 will likely fare much better in this class just due to the sheer amount of math that goes into it. I feel that the level of math in this course detracted from the actual insight by being so ugly and intractable, though this is likely by design. If you took&#x2F;are concurrently enrolled in 110, you&#x27;ll be used to answers coming out beautiful. In this class, however, a beautiful answer probably means you messed up somewhere or made too many assumptions. Take that for what you will.<br/><br/>You complete 3 modeling projects throughout the semester, each one over about a 2 week span (with one pset still due in this time period as well). This feels like too many, and it can be overwhelming. Project 1 will probably be the hardest, followed by Project 2. The final modeling project is by far the most painless and most fun, and also worth the largest portion of your grade. These will be a struggle to complete for most people and I suggest that you find a good group and communicate to reduce the stress of the projects. Most people get around the median on these projects though, so don&#x27;t expect to do wildly better or worse than average as long as you put in adequate effort.<br/><br/>Almost all of the grade differentiation in this class occurs through the midterm and final exams. The midterm is an extreme time crunch, being an in&ndash;class 75 minute exam with 4 true&#x2F;false&#x2F;uncertain questions (you have to write an explanation for each one) and 2 longer free response questions. Most people just give up on trying to work out all the math by the time they get to the final question and start using intuition instead; this can give you substantial credit, so don&#x27;t give up if you can&#x27;t figure out a derivation. The average for the midterm will probably be in the mid 40s, so don&#x27;t stress too much about getting everything; doing perhaps 8 percent above average is enough to be on track for an A.<br/><br/>The final exam was less of a time crunch (3 hours) and more fair, but the average was still just a 49. It is almost entirely focused on post&ndash;midterm concepts from class, so make sure to focus on those in preparation. That&#x27;s a good thing as well, since the post&ndash;midterm content is a lot less spamming of ugly math, instead testing more interesting conceptual understanding (still with a lot of math). Game theory is probably the most satisfying unit of the course and the easiest way to do well on the final since it is mostly self&ndash;contained.<br/><br/>If you want to do well in this class, you MUST go to Aakaash&#x27;s review sessions, especially the ones for the midterm and final exams. Trust me, you will do FAR better on these exams if you go to the review sessions, since Aakaash is the one who writes the exams, and he will give many hints to help you do well on the exams. They will probably not be recorded, so try your best to attend.<br/><br/>This class is known for having a very high grade floor (&gt;75% of students receive an A or A&ndash;; about the top 25% get an A). So if you do your problem sets, go to lecture, go to section, and perhaps read the textbook, it should not be too hard to get an A&ndash;. With additional effort, an A is also not unattainable. Make sure to do the practice exams before the midterm and final to prepare for time pressure and see how they would like you to answer questions.<br/><br/>I entered Harvard intent on pursuing an Econ PhD. After my first year, this was still my plan. However, after about a month of 1011A, I decided that grad school was not for me. Perhaps it&#x27;s just that the mathematical modeling didn&#x27;t appeal to me, or that I&#x27;m just not good enough at math to survive a grad school program. I guess in the end this course was worth it, as it ruled out a career path for me completely and unambiguously. So if you want to see if econ is for you, or you&#x27;re just really good at math, maybe this course is for you. If you&#x27;re applied math econ, you can technically bypass this course (the substitute micro theory courses are far easier), so consider that if the reviews you&#x27;re seeing aren&#x27;t too motivating. I understand what they&#x27;re trying to do with this course, and I appreciate the idea, even if at times it seems a little bit too far.</td>

In theory, this sounds like a great class in that you get to see how the math&#x2F;theory and economic intuition fit together. However, most of the time, this just boils down to repeatedly taking a bunch of nasty partial derivatives and getting messy, uninterpretable answers. The math does get cleaner in the second half of the course, but it still just feels like a hassle and is never particularly enjoyable. The discussions at the beginning of lectures are always interesting, but you&#x27;re almost guaranteed to be completely lost during the actual lecture because Glaeser just simply goes way too fast for most people to comprehend. This means that you&#x27;ll probably have to put in at least 30mins&ndash;1hr after each lecture to go through the lecture notes&#x2F;slides&#x2F;textbook and actually understand the concepts. Overall, though, I do think I learned a lot from the class and would recommend if you&#x27;re interested in working through some of the behind&ndash;the&ndash;scenes math of foundational microeconomic theory. <br/><br/>If you&#x27;re trying to decide between this class and 1010a, I think the main difference really is just the amount of math&#x2F;theory you want to do. The topics are pretty much the same across both courses, but in 1010a, they basically just teach you a bunch of equations that you need to apply, while in 1011a, you learn how to derive all these equations from the basic principles of profit&#x2F;utility maximization.</td>

			<td class="TabularBody_LeftColumn" headers="comment-2_8fb3724e-6302-4a98-8be9-03a0b095cfb3">1011a is definitely a challenging class, but it is well worth the difficulty. If you are even slightly interested in economics, the content will be fascinating, and the presentation of the material and emphasis on methods of modeling the world will give you a much better sense of what “real” economics is like than Ec 10 or 1010. Professor Glaeser is a fantastic lecturer (the policy discussions at the beginning of lecture are a highlight of the class), and his enthusiasm for the subject is infectious. All of the course staff are extremely friendly and very helpful in section, office hours, etc. Aakaash in particular is excellent, and his optional review sessions are a great investment of time — he does an amazing job of going over the intuition for everything and reviewing the most important concepts, so my biggest piece of advice for this course would be to attend these if he is a TF next year. Expect to need to spend time reviewing the lectures (these move quickly and it can be hard to follow all the algebra in the moment), but the weekly work for this class isn’t too overwhelming: problem sets aren’t that bad (especially since they are largely graded on completion), and the modeling projects are also pretty fair (but be sure to start them well in advance!). The exams are definitely difficult but are curved very generously: medians on the midterm&#x2F;final were in the range of 40&ndash;50, but being in the top half should be enough to get an A&ndash; and in the top quarter to get an A. Overall, this is definitely a class that needs consistent commitment, but with that it is a wonderful course and one that will transform how you see the world.</td>

Sure, it may take more time out of your week, but at the end of the day you are at this college to push yourself. Your letter grade relative to alternatives may suffer a bit, but nothing worth losing sleep over. Make it an optimization problem (ironic given that they are the bulk of the course): the marginal cost (grade, time) is far lower than what you gain from this course (appreciation for economics, social indicator of being able to do hard things, work ethic, etc.) The resources are there for you to succeed; put in the work and you will be rewarded.</td>

You must like and be good at math (calculus) and a little bit of statistics (but not really beyond knowing basic distributions like uniform and normal and their pdfs&#x2F;cdfs). Being good at economics is very, very helpful (I&#x27;m eh, but I study CS and enjoy math). The midterm is borderline impossible — on purpose. You will not do good on it, but if you get above like a 40, that&#x27;s gonna set you up really well (even above a 35&ndash;ish is good enough). The final is much longer, but much better. The modeling projects are fun, but get started on them early — get your group together asap or else you&#x27;ll be spending long nights on them. Psets are super chill, basically completion. <br/><br/>Policy discussions during class are interesting bc of Glaeser, but he really glosses over the math. If you feel like you&#x27;re gonna be behind on that, then review the textbook online before class or at least read the CA notes before class (you get so much more out of lecture if you do). I liked the first half of more structured micro (building up foundations for profit&#x2F;utility optimization) than the second half, where we got to various random but still interesting topics (risk aversion, game theory, etc.). Overall, you will do decent in the class (no one gets a terrible grade, lots of B&#x27;s to A&ndash;&#x27;s, with the majority being A&ndash;&#x27;s).<br/><br/>Aakaash, the head TF, is amazing — go to his review sessions weekly and before exams if he is teaching — he is a literal godsend.</td>

This class is great for the people who are interested in economics, but don&#x27;t like the style of the econ 10a&#x2F;10b series, which is more of slideshows&#x2F;graphs&#x2F;definitions. In this class, you actually use math to solve real economic problems. I love that each lecture begins with a real&ndash;world policy discussion, it ties in how what we learn in the class can be used to make policy decisions regarding things like addiction, crime, riots, etc. Very good class, great professor (super enthusiastic and fun).<br/>With that said, the psets are often too difficult and you receive no feedback, the CAs in this class are typically arrogant and you feel very judged when asking questions, and it can feel very intimidating. Aakash is great, though. <br/>The exams are very difficult, but fortunately they are very difficult for everyone&ndash; the median was around a 43. This gets curved, so as long as you can solve a couple of problems, you will do okay.</td>

However, there is not much incentive to put in the effort on a regular basis considering that psets are completion&ndash;based. Also, there is really no feedback on assignments apart from first modeling project. Therefore, it is hard to work well consistently and you are likely to just end up grinding for modeling projects and exams. However, that is the opposite of what you should really do (which I learned the hard way), so if you take it, make sure you actually try to do the psets well. Overall, highly recommended if you actually care about economics (because you will learn exactly nothing in 1010, so there is no other option than taking this class). Also, Professor Glaeser is actually really nice, so make sure to get to know him better</td>
