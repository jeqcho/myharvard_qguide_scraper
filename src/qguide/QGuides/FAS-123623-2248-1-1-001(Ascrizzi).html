I was kind of crazy and took it for fun as a senior, but honestly had a great experience. I would probably recommend people to take it earlier in their college career, because it does provide a lot of foundational knowledge that could be useful in any tech adjacent job or in recruiting or even research, but I got a lot out of it taking it now. I also think it was probably a bit easier for me since I am older and have more experience. Make sure you go to lecture or watch the recorded lectures. beyond helping you better conceptualize and visualize the concepts, they were also just funny experiences. also the problem sets are pretty fun to do, especially the first 3, so don&#x27;t just chat gpt them :(<br/><br/>problem sets 3 and 5 are the hardest and longest so be prepared but the rest (especially 6) are not that bad.<br/><br/>Be prepared to work hard though, everyone in this class works really hard and it shows with the super high grades on everything. <br/><br/>Also Eddie + the rest of the staff are such wonderful people! Would highly highly highly recommend taking Eddie out to Classroom to Table, what a fun time that was :)</td>

They make it intentionally ambiguous, and it&#x27;s impossible to tell what matters and what doesn&#x27;t&#x2F;what you need to do to get an A. It seems like the only actual thing that matters is extra credit and being `present,&#x27; ie posting on ed, going to office hours, and getting recognized. <br/><br/>The content was honestly super fun and the psets were good, just a lot of work.</td>

The time commitment is roughly 25&ndash;30 hours per problem set, and there are 6 psets a semester with some extra credit options. They alternate hard (psets 1,3,5) and easy (2,4,6), but the hard psets coincided with the midterms which was really tough. To do well, you need to go to office hours for the pset. It is basically impossible to do the pset on your own. There were 2 midterms, and while understanding the theory is important, you need to be able to apply what you learn. Do the practice problems. <br/><br/>I will say Eddie is a very engaging lecturer and a good teacher. He always stays after to answer questions, and he is super super insightful. I started out really disliking the class, but over time I grew to really enjoy it, so I think it was worthwhile to take</td>

So glad it&#x27;s over now and I don&#x27;t have to spend another second thinking of this class. Psets are the hardest things in the world, but I admit that they helped me learn so much (way more than the lectures&#x2F;lecture notes). Tests are reasonable, although they sometimes test on very obscure areas and are designed to &quot;trick&quot; you. Additionally, I have so many complaints on the test format for this class. Either force everyone (except DAOs) to take tests in&ndash;person or let everyone take it online. Having a form that students can fill out to take it online for &quot;valid reasons&quot; is irrational, especially since they approve almost all requests. I have heard of students saying they have an &quot;important club meeting&quot; during the test time so they can&#x27;t go in person.  And it is very obvious that it is easier to cheat online than in person. We had 3 total exams and I personally knew of around 7 people that took all 3 online. Maybe it&#x27;s coincidence they all had conflicts, but don&#x27;t be that naive. This both punishes those who are honest and take the exams in&ndash;person, as well as those who actually have genuine conflicts that force them to take it online. Give an equal playing field.</td>

Industry is trying to move away from x86&ndash;64 anyways. If you are a CS concentrator, the credits are structured so you basically have to take this or 141 (and that&#x27;s only an option if yout have a MIPS computer), so you might as well just take the course.</td>

It could be reasonable if you have 0 other classes or responsibilities. However, this is not the case for most Harvard students. I cried multiple times a week because of this class. Due to me having to go to office hours every single day, my relationships with my friends suffered. If you&#x27;re in a relationship, I hope they are very understanding. I truly understood what imposter syndrome is after this semester.<br/>I don&#x27;t really know how much I actually learned from this class. I definitely understand more about how a computer works conceptually. However, the PSETs I found to be so difficult and hard to grasp at all. I know a few of my friends felt the same way, but I obviously can&#x27;t speak for everyone. Office hours tended to be a hit or miss. TF&#x27;s vary dramatically in terms of how helpful they are. Also, they get super busy, so there would be times where I wouldn&#x27;t even get help. Regardless, I wouldn&#x27;t have survived this course without office hours. <br/>On the bright side, life after this class seems so much better in comparison. If you&#x27;re reading this, odds are you have to take it for a CS degree. This class is probably worth it because it knocks 2 requirements out. Just be prepared and good luck!</td>

You will learn everything from data representation, assembly language, to synchronization of  programs running on your computer &ndash; you will learn about how to optimize for memory vs. speed and understand how code actually works. You will learn where all the things you look at on your computer is located. It is incredible. Also, the problem sets in this class are the most reflective of what you are learning. You get to build a shell, parts of an operating system, learn assembly language from the ground up &ndash; it is incredible.

Everyone I knew said this course was terrible and so miserable and difficult so I put it off until my senior fall to take it, but wow I don&#x27;t know why it&#x27;s gotten such bad reviews. Eddie is a PHENOMENAL lecturer. He is a genius coder and such a good teacher. He explains things so clearly and is always so helpful and willing to answer questions or rephrase. I love all of his pictures&ndash;&ndash;he draws out the concepts for us which makes them so clear. If you go to lectures or watch them later, you have everything you need to complete the psets. The course notes online are so helpful and clearly laid out. The problem sets are so clearly laid out and so FUN. You have one pset every two weeks and they are so. much. fun! The first pset is about memory allocation and ik it sounds boring but it was so much fun!! The second pset we had to diffuse a BOMB?!?! How cool is that!! You feel like a cool hacker in a movie when you&#x27;re doing it. All of the psets I had such a blast doing. YES it is going to take hours and hours and hours&ndash;&ndash;BUT it is such a fun process. It is not too difficult&ndash;&ndash;most of it you will be able to do on your own from the lectures and course website and when you get stuck the TFs are incredible and wednesday office hours with pizza are always such a blast. After taking so much theory courses (120 and 124), this course reminded me of the joy of coding again. It was genuinely such a fun time, you just get to solve fun little problem sets with your code and the staff and resources provide it make it challenging but so doable and so so enjoyable. I genuinely do not know why it gets so many bad reviews. I had such a blast. Have so so much fun taking it :) If you go to lectures and see the problem sets as fun puzzle games (don&#x27;t start them too late or you will just be stressed and won&#x27;t be able to enjoy them!), then I promise you will have such a great time.</td>

First, I want to take responsibility and admit that I didn&#x27;t fully engage in the class (missed a lot of lectures, worked on the psets late, never went to office hours...). I had a very busy semester and I didn&#x27;t have time, energy or interest to participate more, which obviously made it a lot more difficult and painful &ndash; so try to avoid that. I also didn&#x27;t really like the material which is not the class fault. But that aside, I still think lecture was kind of confusing, not always felt useful, and difficult&#x2F;boring to watch, and most abstract concepts remained abstract after watching lecture or section and it was really hard to understand what was going on. Also, the class is kind of designed for try hards, as all of the psets have a lot of extra credit that you are implicitly kind of expected to do if you want a good grade, and there are so many practice exercises that is overwhelming. If I had cared about my grade, I would&#x27;ve been very stressed. Thanks god I didn&#x27;t which made everything a bit better. So again take everything with a grade of salt because my involvement wasn&#x27;t exemplary but still my TLDR is I literally couldn&#x27;t wait for this class to end<br/><br/>On the positive side, the professor is really nice, the policies are really flexible, and there seems to be a lot of support through OH, Patel Fellow etc even if I never used it.</td>

If you study computer science, you really need to take this. It&#x27;s no&ndash;frills, well&ndash;taught, and you gain a very deep understanding of the fundamentals of lower level operating system and machine programming. At times it can feel a bit tedious, as low&ndash;level programming is a bit out of style. However, it feels like critical information and concepts to be able to grapple with if you really want to be competent and know what goes on under the hood of applications. This course is even more critical if you plan on working on hardware or something where performance matters.<br/><br/>The PSETs are difficult but fair. If you start them early, you will be able to finish in time. The course also has a very generous late day policy which I really appreciated (6 late days for each half of the course).<br/><br/>Eddie is a phenomenal lecturer. I normally do not attend CS lectures, but I attended every 61 lecture. He&#x27;s passionate about the topic, has a personality, and takes time to answer student questions.<br/><br/>Prepare for this to be your most time&ndash;intensive class.

I’ve taken graduate level algorithms classes and pure math classes and this was by far the most difficult class I’ve taken material&ndash;wise. <br/><br/>But that’s not where my issue lies with this class. The course content is going to be difficult to someone no matter what, I get it. However, the way that this class is set up is beyond me. Here are my main gripes: <br/><br/>1: “Extra credit” practically being required to do decent in the class. The whole point of extra credit is to boost your grade after all of the materials have come in. Meaning if you do decently well on exams and get near a 100 average on problem sets you should be fine for getting an A or whatever your grade lands on the curve. People from cs61 iterations past have said that 20&ndash;30 points of extra credit is required to get such a grade. Why call it extra credit at this point? Just make it a part of the problem set if you’re going to include extra credit in the curve?<br/><br/>2. Participation not being properly defined. Even now I don’t know what my participation score will be. I go to office hours and have been to section every week, but is that enough? I don’t know.  Maybe I didnt ask enough Ed posts. Maybe I didn&#x27;t raise my hand in class enough times. Maybe I didn’t glaze Eddie enough. This part of grading has been elusive every year and you think they would change it but it is still there. <br/><br/>3. The online option to take the exam. This is by far the worst decision course&ndash;organization wise. Obviously there is going to be a discrepancy between people who take an exam in a controlled setting versus people who take it at home with unfettered internet access. They effd around , and they found out when midterm 2 had an average score of around an 80. Which is unheard of in this course since exam medians are usually in the 60&#x2F;70 range. People who took the online exam were required to submit a video explaining one of their answers, which seems fine but it is very easy to use non&ndash;supported materials to inform video answers. As a result people who took the exams in person were punished by the curve. Hopefully grading takes this into account but it is unlikely. <br/><br/>Do I recommend this course? No. Does it matter if I recommend this course? Also no. If you’re studying cs this is the easiest class that fulfills both programming 2 and systems requirements. Just take it and try to make the most of it.</td>

The exams also aren&#x27;t too bad &ndash; they&#x27;re definitely doable if you study for them, but they test lots of fringe corner cases, so I&#x27;d recommend doing the pset extra credit if exams aren&#x27;t your thing.<br/><br/>Eddie is a great lecturer, and the TFs are super helpful! Just be sure to start things &ndash; or at least look at them &ndash; early.

I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s just me and a few others, but he seems annoyed when answering questions from female students especially and was very rude and impatient. Style grading amongst TFs are not very standardized, so can be a bit unfair to students since grading is very dependent on the TF. I also didn&#x27;t like how points earned on extra credit aren&#x27;t transparent since students aren&#x27;t told what is the max number of points each extra credit is worth, especially when I wasn&#x27;t provided comments as to why I got X number of points. <br/><br/>Number of late hours is generous but teaching staff was not very accommodating towards students who experience unexpected personal emergencies as they use the number of late hours to justify why extensions should not be needed because &quot;that&#x27;s what late hours are for&quot;<br/><br/>Overall, the workload was more manageable than cs124 and is probably the best option to take for your systems requirement, but teaching staff can be very unsympathetic towards students so it caused me a lot of stress and pain</td>

Breakdown<br/>Hours: 1, 4, 11, 4, 14, 11, 21, 2, 12, 6, 16, 3, 6, 1, 2, 11.<br/><br/>121 hours &#x2F; 16 weeks = 8 hours per week (but the caveat is I think I had more C++ experience going in than most other students)<br/><br/>As you can see, the biweekly psets really show up at the time commitment. I have already suggested to the course staff to include early check&ndash;ins for the pset (so they will give e.g. 1 point if you submit 40% of the pset early in the first week), but in the case that they don’t implement it, I highly recommend you to implement early check&ndash;ins for yourself. I.e. if a pset is due in two weeks, commit yourself to complete 40% of the pset on the first week.<br/><br/>Read the lecture readings. They are very well&ndash;written. Read them before watching lectures. I do highly recommend watching lectures, since there will be things mentioned in lecture but not in the readings that will show up in the exam. Plus, watching the lecture after the readings helps a lot with reinforcing the concepts.<br/><br/>As for the intellectual, I didn’t like it intellectually during the first two weeks. There was a point where there’s a table of 15 registers, each with weird names like %rdx and %rsi and you are supposed to know that %rdx is the register that holds the third argument of a function and %rsi holds the second. It’s definitely not transferable knowledge, nor would be too practical for most software engineers, and I was mildly intellectually disappointed. However, I later realized that I am the intellectually disappointing one. I was looking at the genesis of modern computer technology, created by people who are still alive, and learnt deeply and broadly the decisions they have made in making computer systems reliable and powerful that now powers all of modern technology and the stupid blue Amtrak screen in front of me that said my train is delayed AGAIN. Regardless, as you learn all the inconsequential information like movq vs movl, you begin to accumulate the ability to understand the lore. And it is rewarding to understand the lore. You don’t notice your ability growing, but soon you have the power to understand how caches work in your computer, and what 8GB memory means when you buy a new laptop, and also appreciate the complexities concurrency. I do agree it is fundamental and I don’t regret taking this class at all.<br/><br/>All the best!</td>

The time commitment is no joke. If you&#x27;re intent on learning the material and completing the psets diligently, you will definitely need to start early, go to office hours often, and reserve multiple hours for debugging your code. My advice is to complete the psets in the most efficient way possible: don&#x27;t get stuck on one phase or test case for more than a day, use the Ed board for help, and go to office hours the week before the deadline before the TFs get inundated with students.<br/>2. In my year, the class was taught by Eddie. With his teaching style, the psets and the tests are very different. The psets are all about implementing the system structures taught in class, while the tests focus on having a broad understanding of why systems are designed a certain way, which Eddie does well going over in lecture. However, lecture is often not enough to perform well on the tests, because he doesn&#x27;t usually have time to go over all the small details. Make sure to read the posted lecture notes on the website in addition to going to lecture! The test questions also have a certain style that it will be useful to get familiar with. Make sure to do as many practice problems before each exam.<br/><br/>CS61 is indeed a really tough class, but I do think the material is taught very well. You learn a lot of things about how computers work and gain a greater appreciation for the work done by all the systems programmers who made all of our phones and computers possible.</td>

Both of these learnings have been the result of a ton of time poured into the class, because this class is truly a grind. The lectures are not super clear, and the problem sets have a steep learning curve. Much of the time I put into this class, I felt like I was trying to piece together a ton of disparate information that was thrown at me, none of which was particularly profound or interesting.

It will give you actual programming experience, improve your work ethic and introduce you to the world of systems. I really liked this course, but it&#x27;s fair to say that the learning curve was sometimes brutal. I only had CS50 and CS20 as my computer science background, and pset1 was just awful. CS61 is really fun, and the topics you learn about are fascinating (very broad overview: how does the computer processor manage memory, assembly instructions, what makes a program faster than another, etc.), but you will spend a seemingly infinite amount of time debugging code.<br/><br/>Start your psets early (read: within 48h of when they&#x27;re out), and keep working on them throughout the week. Psets 1,3,5 are the hardest while 2,4,6 are much more manageable. Professor Kohler is an amazing teacher &ndash; go to his office hours regularly, even if just to listen to explanations of the material. Focus on doing the exercises during and after section (the exercises are provided on the website), and don&#x27;t waste your time taking conceptual notes. The concepts are really easy to understand in CS61 &ndash; DON&#x27;T BE FOOLED! The psets will require a whole different layer of learning. I never read the textbook, and I don&#x27;t think that impacted my learning in any way. Just. Do. The. Exercises.<br/><br/>Go to lecture. It&#x27;s recorded, which makes it tempting to skip, but it&#x27;s actually very useful to attend and ask questions in&ndash;person. The TFs are hit or miss in CS61; find a few that are helpful, and stick with their section. Also, choose a section that&#x27;s earlier in the week &ndash; it will help you with the pset. The office hours of TFs are generally not that helpful, but you can see what works for you. I never had a pset group, and I kinda regret that, but you can still do well if you manage your time efficiently.<br/><br/>Oh, and do the extra credit for the psets.

There is extra credit so if you know you don&#x27;t do well on exams, DO THE EC!!! Pleeeeaaaaaseeeeeeee you can rack up so many bonus points so don&#x27;t be silly like me and not do them.
