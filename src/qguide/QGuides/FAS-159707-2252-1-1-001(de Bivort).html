Considering this I think the best advice I can gives is that it&#x27;s important to remember is that when you tell yourself &quot;I will do anything if it means I can take this course&quot;, or &quot;I will put as much time and work into this class as I need to&quot;, you can&#x27;t anticipate the reality. The all nighter&#x27;s in the library 2 days before the midterm when you&#x27;re on your 4th celsius and you still have 8 lectures to go through, that 8 page essay you&#x27;re hit with right after the exam because you&#x27;ve put everything else in your life off to study for this exam, or spending 6 hours on part b of a pset question because stat mech is hard, this will be your reality if you don&#x27;t have an excellent educational background. I don&#x27;t regret taking this course because of the people I met, but I honestly cannot recommend it to someone who came from a really terrible high school or doesn&#x27;t have a thorough background in Calculus, Chemistry, and Bio because it really does make a difference. <br/><br/>If you plan on taking this course, it&#x27;s excellent for a pre&ndash;graduate school path because of the sheer amount of content it covers. You&#x27;ll be able to explore so many different interesting fields and learn how to think independently. Some general advice on the course:<br/>&ndash; The TFs will cycle throughout the year, some of them will be extremely helpful with PSETs and exam content, you just need to figure out which<br/>&ndash; The CAs are absolutely wonderful, and a great resource for help on PSETs<br/>&ndash; Not all of the lecture content will be relevant to your exams<br/>&ndash; If you have no background in coding, I highly recommend watching some videos or teaching yourself some basic python. Coding is apart of almost every single PSET and it can be quite tedious if you&#x27;ve never done it before<br/>&ndash; On exams, displaying an understanding of the topic even when you have no idea how to answer the question can typically get you some credit <br/>&ndash; Take some time later each day to go over the lecture and ask yourself &quot;What do they want me to take away from this&quot;, I started doing this 2nd semester and found it quite helpful<br/>&ndash; If an outside resource presents itself, use it. It can&#x27;t hurt and it will usually help<br/><br/>And by far the best thing you can do if you take this course, is make friends. Your classmates will make this course so worth it (and bearable at times). When I was pulling all nighters in lamont, the friends I was with and our 3am CVS runs made me keep going. When it was 4am and I was crashing out about stat mech, it was a friend who stayed up with me and helped me find the algebra mistake in my derivations. The community you can find in this randomly selected group of 40 people is truly something special :)</td>

That being said, I&#x27;m not sure that I would take this class if I could go back. For one, this class isn&#x27;t great for concentration requirements if you are not MCB&#x2F;CPB. In addition, I personally wasn&#x27;t a big fan of some of the TFs, I thought grading was a bit strange, and overall, while the class size is small and you get to know your fellow LS50ers (which is awesome by the way, by far the most valuable thing I got from this class were the friends), the course just wasn&#x27;t for me. I guess I like learning the things that I am truly passionate about, and am not really interested in other things (for instance, I am not interested in evolutionary bio, which was a significant part of this semester). While this class teaches you a little about a lot, I would rather learn a lot about a little (I don&#x27;t know if that makes sense lol but that&#x27;s just my opinion). However, professors are great, pretty funny, and CAs are super nice. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend LS50 to people, but I wouldn&#x27;t tell them not to take it either.<br/><br/>On the bright side, this semester was mainly math, which I was very happy with (I like the math and quantitative stuff much more than bio and chem). The exams were also fair, but again, some of the grading of exams and problem sets were strange and I had to go and speak to TFs and get points back (they are very rigid with their grading structure, don&#x27;t use any strategies or equations that weren&#x27;t taught in class otherwise they just take points off).<br/><br/>This class will help you figure out what you are interested in studying and where you want to go into more advanced study, but once you figure that out, this class seems like it is dragging on and on. Take this class if you need to figure out the direction you need to take in college. If you don&#x27;t need to, I would not take this class.</td>

I don&#x27;t think I really need to explain anything there. The one thing I will say, is that taking 21B alongside LS 50 really helped the linear algebra part. <br/><br/>Also, the professors really care about you as a student and want you to do well. If you run into trouble, whether academically or personally, I highly recommend talking to Emma. I understand that Andrew is less approachable even though he is the course head, but Emma is so easy to talk to about everything. They are super understand and do their best to help.</td>

Great class though! As you&#x27;ve probably read in the LS50A qguide, it&#x27;s hard but very, very fulfilling.</td>

I&#x27;d say making it through LS50a is the hardest part of this course, so congrats!! You&#x27;ll really get to enjoy some of the more complicated and niche parts of research biology that you get into in LS50b as compared to LS50a. The worst is behind you but that is not a reason to let go. You still have to be persistent in the game of acquiring knowledge. Keep on utilizing your resources from the Teaching staff to the TFs and CAs. Develop those strong bonds with your classmates. Good luck!!</td>

If you&#x27;re deliberately reading this Q, you either are contemplating this course sequence or staying in LS50b&#x2F;dropping to LS1b. I hope the following information is helpful in guiding your decision, and once you make it, do not look back because the &quot;grass is always greener on the other side.&quot;<br/><br/>tldr: I was considering the switch to LS1b. I am glad I stayed in this course because of the community (I met some of my closest friends) and niche expertise of the professors (they are truly cool people and robust researchers). With that said, if you have a gut feeling that you should switch to LS1b, do it; we had one person switch due to different STEM interests and she was happy with her decision at the end of the semester. If LS50 had a toxic or competitive student environment, I would’ve undoubtedly done LS1b with Math 21a this semester.<br/><br/>First, I will go into some of the positives about LS50. I believe this course has an amazing community that cannot be seen in many other classes except maybe Math 55. It’s a mix of trauma bonding at 3 am, learning about each other while psetting, going for late night Felipe’s&#x2F;El Jefe’s runs together, etc. As people start to form smaller subgroups this semester, I’ve met incredible friends who I hope to stay close with for the rest of my life. You can also learn lots from your peers, as many LS50ers are RSI, Regeneron STS, SSP, and ISEF alums. The course assistants (CAs) and teaching fellows (TFs) are also remarkable; they genuinely care about you and your success, which is important for a class like Life Sciences 50.<br/><br/>Academically, the professors are all very supportive and interesting people who have done cutting&ndash;edge research. LS50 will expose you to a diversity of scientific disciplines, which can help you decide on a future concentration. While a lot of ppl think they have a good idea coming in, by the end, many of my peers’ academic trajectories changed. Some switched from Neuro to Chem&#x2F;Physical Bio; some dropped premed; some leaned more into HDRB. For the lab component, take advantage of this opportunity! Kevin was a joy to work with and compared to other courses, you spent most time actually *doing science* rather than spending hours on pre&ndash;labs and busy work. <br/><br/>Note on the professors: Andrew is hilarious and is truly an inspiring scientist on yeast genetics. Emma is like an LS50 mom and was a gem to have. Cara is very clear and an amazing person to talk to about comp bio interests. Ben, while sometimes overloading lectures, is a cool person and great to know. Michael is also hilarious, and while his expectations are sometimes too high, he can explain things remarkably well.<br/><br/>On the flip side, there are some IMPORTANT things to keep in mind. While it gets better after the first midterm, there’s still a very strong mathematical emphasis in the course. Overall, I liked the content of LS50b more but it’s a lie to say that it’s traditional bio&#x2F;chem in the second half of the semester. I included a few notes below:<br/><br/>&ndash; You WILL learn linear algebra in two weeks, but some of the hardcore material is honestly too much if you don’t have a *strong* mathematical foundation. It sometimes took a toll on both the physical and mental health of people I was close with in the class, including myself. No pset should cause people to pull multiple all&ndash;nighters or feel any negative thoughts; however, the tight&ndash;knit community allowed us to support each other during rough patches. This may be controversial among course staff but after talking with peers, lots of stat mech and dynamical systems could be replaced with more niche bio topics that set us up better for orgo (like Chem 20 &ndash; which you shouldn’t take with LS50b!), SCRB 10, etc.  Yes, we’re at Harvard; yes, this course is voluntary; yes, we’re supposed to be “the brightest future for science”; nonetheless, we are 18&#x2F;19&ndash;year&ndash;olds figuring out our identities and the course expectations were too intense at times.<br/><br/>&ndash; The rumor that every individual who takes this course gets an A and will get into PRISE&#x2F;research village program is false. Out of the ~40 students, 15&ndash;17 will get an A; 15&ndash;17 will get an A&ndash;; and about 7&ndash;9 will end with a B+. I would assume it’s possible to get lower if you slack off significantly or cheat on exams. While participation in class is important (DON’T BE SCARED TO ASK QUESTIONS DURING LECTURE IF YOU TAKE LS50), your grade is basically dependent on the 3 midterms. You should get above the median on 2 out of 3 if you want an A, which is not always doable without serious dedication or being an inherently gifted mathematician&#x2F;budding biologist with an innate understanding of chemistry. Practice problems are critical versus passive studying, though the quantity of practice problems were sometimes lacking.<br/><br/>&ndash; I don’t necessarily regret taking LS50 and I know the course staff gets frustrated when students only think about grades, but it’s possible to be intellectually curious AND care about grades. LS50 may have prevented certain fellowships later on in college (lots of students get As broadly due to easier intro courses&#x2F;grade inflation), and it’s unlikely that one can make the Phi Beta Kappa GPA cutoff with A&ndash;s or B+s (it counts for 2 classes each semester), even with straight As for subsequent semesters. There is no shame in taking LS1b. Since LS50 is mostly quantitative, it’s hard to say that I am less prepared for graduate school in biology&#x2F;chemistry or even medicine in the future just because I struggled with topics like stat mech and Markov chains.<br/><br/>&ndash; Students from amazing STEM magnet, international, or private schools have a clear advantage and it at times disadvantages those from under&ndash;funded or STEM&ndash;lacking high schools. I feel like there is a general correlation between getting an A in LS50 and doing Olympiads in HS, attending magnet schools that teach linalg&#x2F;orgo, not being first&ndash;gen, etc. Though I want to avoid making generalizations, and if you devote sufficient time, anyone can succeed!<br/><br/>&ndash; Some weeks feel quite disjointed and comparable to academic whiplash with topics alternating on different days. I don’t think it’s an issue per se, but it sometimes makes reviewing material challenging. I think this was expected going into the course. Also, I wish the course staff did more direct Python instruction or a spring workshop, since many of the PSET Colabs would take hours on end.<br/><br/>Take everything with a grain of salt. By the end, if you accept the challenge, you will truly embrace the class motto “By all means necessary.” Otherwise, please be sure to enjoy your freshman year at Harvard—it’s a pretty special time!</td>

Ranging from Linear Algebra and Markov Chains to population genetics and understanding the p&ndash;value, math is very much intertwined into this semester. This also means there is a lot more coding.<br/><br/>Do not be fooled by previous Psets, this semester of LS50 is not easier than the other one. You are just more equipped to handle the workload. However, I will say to take this course with caution, especially if you might already have the requirements earned in this course. LS50 is a very taxing class and in this semester you may lose some of the spark and enjoyment of the first semester. <br/><br/>The community is still great and you lab was really fun this semester.

After taking this course, I have thought very hard about whether I regretted my decision, and the answer is no, I don&#x27;t. However, I think prospective students should know a few things before enrolling.<br/><br/>LS50 is an intensive introduction to the life sciences with lectures every day for the full year. Although you aren&#x27;t required to take it both semesters, it is highly encouraged to continue throughout the year as concepts build on another. There are several brilliant rotating professors who take turns teaching you different parts of chemistry, biology and statistics and all have their strengths and are both brilliant scientists and good people.<br/><br/>I am a passionate science student who loves biology and chemistry, with a decent math background (AP Calc BC). I had never taken physics or computer science before and this component of the course was tough for me. As someone interested in fields beyond the natural sciences (like engineering), one of the major downsides to ls50 is that it is not heavily recognized by the engineering department which is incredibly frustrating. That being said, there are no major downsides to taking the course as a prospective engineering major, and while you may have to take a couple extra classes later on, you will manage to catch up fine, with the concepts and mindset that LS50 granted you only helping supplement your learning.<br/><br/>Next, LS50 is no joke. There are easier ways to fulfill requirements and graduate Harvard, and this is a class to take for the experience, community and value of learning beyond what most folks take. I personally loved our small community (I was so worried everyone was going to be a high&ndash;powered, competitive life science genius and while everyone in our class was brilliant and incredibly knowledgable in their own right, the humbleness and genuine kindness, along with the sense that we were mutually struggling through the course was one of the highlights of my freshman year). <br/><br/>The course staff (especially Emma) are brilliant and there to answer your questions. In short, if you take this course it will be hard but you probably wont regret it. Come in humble, and know that you know nothing, be kind and supportive and recognize that everyone comes to LS50 with different strengths and backgrounds. Love your people, and they will love you.<br/><br/>Lastly, if you&#x27;re even considering this class, drop your name in the lottery and let fate decide for you. More and more people try to enroll and the course only has space for 40 people, so you might not even get in, in which case you will have a brilliant experience in LS1b. Either way, <br/> good luck, whatever happens, know you made the right decision for you and you wont regret it in the future, and know that the LS50 community will exist to support you &lt;3<br/> &ndash; Proud Lsfiftyan, 2024&ndash;25</td>

You learn some linear algebra, graph theory, sequence analysis, phylogeny, population genetics, etc. You definitely have to study a ton for the exams, but it is so worth it. I also recommend going to the professor&#x27;s office hours and CA office hours. Don&#x27;t be afraid to ask for help or admit that you don&#x27;t understand something. It is expected that you won&#x27;t understand. You will just hold yourself back from everything you stand to gain from this class. The community is the best.

If you are seriously considering taking this course, you have within you the ability to not only survive, but thrive despite seemingly endless lectures and a near&ndash;constant deluge of problem sets.

If you are on the fence, here is what I will say: be prepared for a lot of math. When I came into college, I really wanted to improve and sharpen my math skills, and I believe that this class did it for me. It completely changed my perspective of biology and allowed me to truly consider to quantitative&#x2F;computational aspects of science. Overall, I would say you do not need to come from a very mathematical background to take this class, but you may have to put in a few extra hours to understand concepts. Office hours are also incredibly helpful, and you should definitely go to them. The class is taught basically exclusively lecture&ndash;style, so office hours, specifically one&ndash;on&ndash;one with the professors, is a great way to really understand concepts. There are problem sets once a week, which can take quite a lot of time, but they are helpful for understanding &ndash;&ndash; CA office hours are the best place to go to get help with problem sets.

The topics are relatively simpler but the rigor remains the same. The TFs are wonderful, just like first semester, and they certainly help a lot with understanding of the concepts. If you are not willing to focus your time on this class, it will be difficult to do well in this class or will require a ton of late nights and tears to get through. <br/><br/>The thing I took away MOST from this class was the people. Through trauma bonding, late pset nights, and lab experiments, you will become so close to everyone in the class and they will definitely be your support system through the semester. I am so happy that I will be taking these friendships with me into the future even though we are leaving LS50 behind.

I would still highly recommend it especially if you want to learn more about the computational aspects of biology. I really appreciated going into the more nitty gritty of things like homology search and PCA, because it gave me a much better understanding of these &quot;blackbox&quot; processes. Be prepared to suffer during linear algebra (so much content in so little time + very long pset).

In LS50b, linear algebra was extremely confusing to me, having not taken coursework in linear algebra before, and some of the professors can sometimes be unsympathetic to students&#x27; confusion.

You have the flexibility to choose the extent to which that happens, but it was one of the most immersive experiences I&#x27;ve ever had. To quote LS50 alumni and numerous Cabot passerby, it is &quot;cult&ndash;like&quot; (in the best possible way).<br/><br/>The teaching team is brilliant, full stop. I was deeply, deeply devastated on the last day of lecture because I had to live with the knowledge that I would never attend another LS50 lecture. Don&#x27;t miss out.<br/><br/>Overall, I found that the time commitment for LS50b was similar to LS50a. The first third of LS50b might have been my favorite part of the entire course (linear algebra, PCA, graph theory, neuroscience, Hodgkin&ndash;Huxley). LS50b covers a lot: from protein structure and neuroscience to computational biology, molecular evolution, and phylogenetics. There’s quite a good balance of perspectives: whether you find yourself leaning more toward biochemistry or computational biology, you&#x27;ll find yourself continually engaged.<br/><br/>There&#x27;s something rare and beautiful about how LS50 normalizes not knowing immediately, that holds space for uncertainty as part of learning. LS50 felt safe to me (even in moments of confusion) and hopefully it will for you too. When I arrived at college, I thought I’d end up pursuing MCB, planetary science, or even government. LS50 cracked open a world that reminded me how much I love biology. I&#x27;m now considering Applied Math + Bio and HDRB purely because of how beautifully this course reframed the study of life. <br/><br/>From study sessions in Cabot to meeting every weekday at 10:30, cooking shared meals, watching movies, taking late&ndash;night walks along the Charles, and belting Wicked in lab (Kevin, please avert your eyes. We were absolutely locked in), the sense of connection LS50 brings is unlike anything I’ve experienced in a class before. <br/><br/>LS50b is worth it.

Nonetheless, it was all so incredibly worth it. <br/>This will be said in many other responses but the community in this class is unmatched. The TFs and CAs and course instructors are incredible and their knowledge and support is something I will forever be grateful for. Also note: despite this class being a big time commitment (at least for me), it didn&#x27;t stop me from making room for other activities on campus (basically, this class will always be here for you but will not entirely consume your life if you want to do other things too!)<br/>Some advice I wish I did know: plan ahead for midterms and how you will study for midterms. Keep track of what general topics are covered from each lecture—this helped me a lot with studying for the last two exams so I knew what to look for. Especially if you have double midterms (CHEM20...) prepare beforehand as best you can. Get some sleep, and talk to the TFs and instructors if you ever have trouble with anything, they truly want to help you and it&#x27;s genuinely meant the world. Lastly, the second semester is not easier than the first, which is not meant to stress anyone out at all! But keep up your studying and do your best to keep track of things—and talk to everybody!

You’ll come out of it with a much stronger grasp of how biology, chemistry, physics, math, and coding all connect, but getting there isn’t easy. The workload is intense, especially in the second semester, and burnout is a real possibility if you don’t stay on top of things or give yourself breaks. Sometimes the lectures can feel overwhelming or fast&ndash;paced, and it’s easy to feel like you’re falling behind. That’s why it’s so important to go to office hours regularly, the teaching staff is incredibly supportive and genuinely wants to help you succeed. Talking through problems with TFs or just hearing things explained a different way can really help when things aren’t clicking. Also, don’t be afraid to rely on your classmates, group chats, and study sessions can be life&ndash;saving.
