Nevertheless,, elderhood remains an understudied stage of human life that, in many societies today, brings with it unique challenges, including increased risks of poverty, isolation, and chronic disease. This course will examine the role that ethnographic research and writing can play in illuminating the drivers, experiences, and moral stakes of those negotiating poverty and chronic disease in old age. Through a series of case studies drawn from anthropological literature, it will examine themes of elderhood, chronicity, belonging, identity, illness, kinship, infirmity, care, and a good death in relation to political economies of aging. Students will also complete a semester-long, independent ethnographic research and writing project to explore one of these themes, or a related theme, in greater detail.

Many of these communities attribute this distress to their long colonial encounters with European settlers. Concurrently, throughout the 20th century, the disciplines and professions associated with mind, brain, and behavior (e.g., psychiatry, psychoanalysis, psychology) consolidated their authority and influence within mainstream society. These “psy-ences” promote their professional practices (e.g., diagnosis, psychotherapy) as plausible remedies for Indigenous social suffering, but many Indigenous communities remain skeptical of—and resistant to—these clinical approaches, primarily for cultural and political reasons. In this seminar, we will consider whether and how the concepts, categories, tools, and techniques of the mental health professions might be appropriately adapted and/or adopted for use with Indigenous communities in an increasingly globalized world. In recognition of the (post)colonial status of these populations, we will attend closely to alterNative cultural and spiritual approaches that have been identified and promoted by Indigenous people themselves as conducive to healing and wellness.

How to weigh the many competing trade-offs among diverse stakeholders?  How to balance innovation with pragmatism?  In this class we will develop strategies to address these, and other, challenges. While the course will emphasize the development of a stage-based analytical approach, we will also discuss alternative models of policy analysis and consider critical perspectives from political science, behavioral science and design fields.Based largely on case discussions, the class will explore the choices facing decision makers in the public and nonprofit sectors in the US and abroad with regard to a wide range of issues, including public health, environmental protection, urban development, transportation and infrastructure.  We will also have a unit on cost benefit analysis and how to incorporate it into this analytical toolbox.  We will approach CBA from a critical perspective and consider its limitations in the face of scarce information and equity concerns. This is a methods course: we will use a variety of cases to practice and become nimble in the logic and techniques behind policy analysis, rather than becoming an expert in any one subject area.  Students will develop their own analyses and learn how to communicate them in written memos, oral argument, and visual presentations.

The first part of the course will focus on linear and nonlinear probabilistic generative/regression models (e.g., linear, logistic, Poisson regression), and algorithms for optimization (ML/MAP estimation) and Bayesian inference in these models. We will pay particular attention to sparsity-induced regression models, because of their relation to artificial neural networks, the topic of the second part of the course. The second part of the course will introduce students to the nascent and exciting research area of model-based deep learning and sparse auto-encoders. We will see, for instance, how neural-networks with ReLU nonlinearities arise from sparse probabilistic generative models introduced in the first part of the course. This will form the basis for a rigorous recipe we will teach you to build interpretable deep neural networks, from the ground up. More broadly, model-based deep learning and sparse auto-encoders have become popular approaches to reverse-engineer intelligence in both biological and artificial settings: in each case, we are able to train these systems to perform complicated tasks, but our understanding of how they do so remains opaque.Reverse engineering intelligence—whether in the brain or in artificial neural networks—means using mathematical tools to reveal what information these systems truly represent. By moving beyond performance metrics to probe internal representations, we gain interpretability and transparency, with real-world benefits for the safety, fairness, and trustworthiness of modern AI and brain-machine systemsWe will invite an exciting lineup of speakers.

This survey of statistical causal inference begins with foundational concepts: the potential outcomes framework and counterfactual random variables, graphical modeling frameworks, and common assumptions and strategies for the identification of the causal effects of static and dynamic interventions. Methodological extensions for studying the causal effects of time-varying, longitudinal interventions will be touched upon as well. Further topics to be addressed may include instrumental variables approaches, principal stratification, causal mediation analysis, treatment effect heterogeneity, the causal dose-response curve, and causal survival analysis. This course may also introduce elements of semi-parametric theory necessary for the development of asymptotically efficient estimators of causal effect estimands.

This course reviews the foundations of causal inference in (bio)statistics, outlining causal-analytic methods that help to extract as much evidence as imperfect observational studies carry about causal effects commonly of interest in applied health science settings. This survey of statistical causal inference begins with foundational concepts: the potential outcomes framework and counterfactual random variables, graphical modeling frameworks, and common assumptions and strategies for the identification of the causal effects of static and dynamic interventions. Methodological extensions for studying the causal effects of time-varying, longitudinal interventions will be touched upon as well.

In general, current understanding of most aspects of biology is not complete or specific enough to provide theories in which predictions can be made by analysis or computer simulation. Computer science is the study of step-by-step processes and of specifications of the outcomes that such processes can realize. For many computational outcome specifications, it is known or believed that no mechanism with feasible resources can realize them.

Redefining Urban Design,DES 3517,Joan Busquets,2026 Spring,Full Term,,,,,,19548,223942,No Consent,,,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,"The field of urban design is undergoing a process of major transformation. Josep Lluís Sert’s initial definition as the space between planning and architecture, emphasizing the culture of cities as “civic culture” and proposing pedestrian interaction as the “underlying coherence” of the work developed at different scales, followed his reinterpretation of the CIAM. This began at the GSD in 1956 with the Urban Design Program and has evolved continuously for seven decades. This seminar sets out to contribute to redefining urban design by enhancing theoretical principles and exploring innovative practices in the field.Industrialization and progress guided development throughout the 20th century, resulting in financial globalization, and the advancement of forms of communication and digital development. The emergence of new forms of economy that impact the conception and design of the city allows us to consider more creative alternatives to those of the prevailing globalization process. This is the framework in which we wish to situate discussion in the seminar.Defining this new urban field calls for a more in-depth study of projects that represent the roles or issues that urban design can address. It also requires us to produce design actions and strategies within the urbanistic discipline through research and practice. The design of the present-day city must consider environmental and climate challenges, digital impact, a knowledge-based economy, multiple and changing modes of mobility, as well as the more demanding aspirations of an older and more educated population.The seminar method is based on facing today’s challenges by considering ongoing projects or research that allow us to understand that development is not linear and univocal; rather there are open and varied solutions centering on housing, energy, transport, etc. The process is a plural one, and the solutions in each case depend largely on the context, including aspirations, limitations, and available technologies.The Seminar is based on research into sixteen topics that define current thinking and practice of urban design and projecting them into the future. We are selecting certain topics and case studies to advance the discussion of theoretical background, design tools, development process, and the conditions of agency and governance. Topics are structured within a theoretical framework, using relevant case studies and key projects to show the scope and conditions for the development of each chapter. Research is organized in four blocks corresponding to different scales and approaches, and an introduction.The four main blocks are:- Long-term strategies operating at different scales.- Systematic forms of transition from the present-day city.- Infilling and upgrading.- Experimenting with new design issues.Above all, we will be interested in the way this discipline develops plans, projects, and strategies, within the extraordinary complexity of today’s urban design field.

How do design culture and design thinking transform over time? How are cultural values embedded in the design of landscapes? This course is framed in terms of the relationship of landscape architecture to the evolving theorizations of nature and culture. In each class, we will map various critical assumptions, ideologies, and aspirations that inform how landscape is designed and interpreted. By learning to read landscapes and related projects of landscape architecture, we will study the constructedness of landscape. Conversely, we will also examine the capacities of landscape architecture to shape identity and ecology, reproduce or contest power relations and inequality, and commemorate diverse cultural meaning.The course elaborates a working definition of theory as it relates to landscape practice. It contextualizes the discipline’s transition from a modernist paradigm in the West, to the gradual eradication of conceptual binaries and the pluralization of narratives in the late twentieth century. It considers landscape’s ‘social’ engagements to include non-human actors, and concludes with recent materialist approaches to landscape that emphasize its performance and flows in the era of global warming.The course weaves together three kinds of investigations: one that focuses on built forms, another on the ideas and conceptual frameworks that guide the production of those forms, and a third that examines the retrospective interpretation of those forms. We will attend to diverse projects and topics, that may include border regions, urban landscapes, agricultural landscapes, colonial plantations, scientific gardens, territories of extraction, zones of environmental risk, successional forests, migrating ecosystems, national parks, native lands, domestic spheres, and postcolonial gardens. Through these sites, we will critically explore the spatial forms of exclusion, inclusion, conflict, and cooperation between and among people and their surroundings.At the end of this class, students will understand the value and make use of theory in design, will be able to articulate the diverse intellectual, social, and political dimensions of landscapes, and to refer to a history of landscape architecture projects oriented to related issues. Students will also be able to articulate their priorities within the discipline.

Taking Anthony Vidler’s Third Typology as a starting point, the seminar proposes the fourth typology as a common framework for the production of an architecture of the city in today’s globalized context. Unlike the first three typologies that found their justification for sociality from nature, the machine and the historical city respectively; the fourth typology is rooted in the developmental city. The first half of the seminar will begin with the understanding of type from Quatremère de Quincy and J.N.L Durand through the dialectics of idea and model. This renewed understanding of type and typology will offer an alternative reading of the writings and projects of Aldo Rossi and Rem Koolhaas as attempts to revalidate architecture’s societal and political role through the redefinition of the idea of the city. This idea of the city will be discussed through Aristotle’s polis, Schmitt’s ‘homogenous demos’, Mouffe’s ‘agonistic pluralism’, Rossi’s ‘collective memory’, Agamben’s ‘dispositif’ and Koolhaas’ ‘heterogeneous containments’.The second half of the seminar will be focused on the history and theory behind the emergence of the developmental city and its corresponding dominant types. This discussion will cover the various urban and typological outcomes instigated by the rapid transformation of cities, its peripheries and countryside, following this developmental model - examples will be drawn from China, London, and Singapore. The reading and understanding of these emerging conceptions of the city will be guided by the concepts and theories offered in the first half of the course.

Another major category of innovation is the rise of genomic medicine and personalized healthcare. These advances can create major patient benefits but also operational hurdles as care becomes tailored for the individual patient. Students will gain a lens into the complexities of reimbursement and the benefits and risks of early adoption of technology. The course will also explore how the innovation curve is dynamic and how healthcare organizations translate innovation in different settings.",,Harvard Medical School,,,Clinical Service Operations,Lecture,Online,HMS Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory,MCSO + MQHS Students,,,

Despite this trend, the organization and governance of healthcare organizations are not always well aligned  with the development of service lines, and clinical operations leaders need insight in how to advance change and work towards models of care that best support the patient and organizational goals. Typical service lines may be disease-focused like cancer, heart disease, neurosciences, digestive diseases, and behavioral health; or focused on different populations like women's health, children's health, or geriatrics; or may be more procedureal or location-based including transplant, dialysis, critical care/ICU, perioperative services, or emergency medicine. A key driver for the establishment of service lines is the need for a complex set of clinical services that span ambulatory, procedural, and inpatient settings, as well as require high degrees of multi-disciplinary management and integration of clinical research. Physician alignment is necessary in all service line models and there are novel approaches to organizing physicians in service lines. Service lines are often a vehicle for program development, capital investment, and can be leveraged for philanthropy and naming gifts. Clinical operations leaders and service line leaders play a critical leadership role in the day-to-day management and strategic planning of these operations. This course will provide context of how service lines fit into the overall framework of a hospital, and will cover all aspects of service line leadership and management including governance, financial planning, accounting, quality control, operations, capital planning, business development, and patient centered care.

Today, this discussion is as relevant as ever, gaining renewed urgency in the face of numerous crises—be they environmental or related to equity and inclusion.The course will explore the study and analysis of cities, context, and situations to formulate spatial interventions and urban transformations. It does so by examining existing theory and various architectural practices, highlighting the ‘context’ as an environmental, cultural, and social resource in the development and envisioning of spatial interventions.Moreover, it provides tools for analyzing and understanding urban structures, fabrics, and situations, and for translating these into architectural potentials and spatial imaginaries. It further engages in critical discussions, on how to create meaningful spatial interventions and urban transitions, that can foster more sustainable, livable, and equitable cities.This seminar’s aim is to establish a method to analyze and use existing urban situations and context as a driver in design development. Students will work in pairs for this assignment, which consists of two parts.In Part One, they will analyze how the existing context and the analysis hereof can inform spatial interventions by reviewing literature and examining current and past architectural practices. All students will read and discuss the provided literature, with each group responsible for reviewing one text. Additionally, each student group will analyze a contemporary urban design project. The focus is on how existing urban situations influence spatial interventions and designs, exploring the relationship between urban situations and context, concept, and final design. The analysis also addresses the specific tools/methods used in the analysis of urban situations and contexts and in the translation into design concepts. Students also evaluate how the spatial intervention aims to improve the area and express their opinions on its success.In Part Two, each student group individually analyzes a designated Boston site using tools from Part One. It is crucial to explore various analytical tools across scales and subjects, critically assessing analyses in relation to the case-study area and discussing them in terms of identified potentials for spatial interventions. Based on their analysis, each group will propose a spatial intervention that positively impacts the site and context, addressing aspects such as community building, resilience, connectivity, or housing. The concepts should be presented through diagrams or collages, serving as initial ideas pointing towards the development of design projects.",,Graduate School of Design,,,Urban Planning & Design,Project-based Seminar,In Person,GSD Graded,,,,
Eco-Machinae: Environmental Machines and Material Mechanisms,DES 3537,Karen Bar-Sinai,2026 Spring,Full Term,,,,,,19578,226915,No Consent,,,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,"They are at work all around us, why haven’t we seen them? This seminar will aim to define a family of tools - environmental machines - intentionally designed constructs that perform tasks centered on assessing, adjusting, or altering the environment.  What roles do Eco-Machinae play in sensing, shaping, restoring, or collaborating with their environments? How do they interface with ecological systems, and how are these interfaces evolving in response to new technologies and growing environmental pressures? We will investigate this under-addressed, never-clearly-defined type of machines that have so far escaped conventional historiographies yet will determine our relationship and interactions with the environment in the future.This seminar will answer these questions through theory and exploration. While we have developed advanced human-machine and even machine-machine interfaces, the ways machines interact with the environment have seldom been specifically studied. These range from historical constructs such as sundials, wind towers, and water screws, to contemporary tools like rovers, construction and earthwork robots, climate-regulating tools that seed clouds and manipulate weather, digital twins simulating performance, AI-driven ecological simulators, and even materials that act as machines through intrinsic behaviors, such as fungi used for targeted decay to support fabrication processes.Eco-machina will serve both as a theoretical lens and as a material strategy. Rather than viewing machines as merely mechanical devices, we consider them as landscape or material constructs—embedded in the ground, tailored to specific performances, and shaped by site, climate, and material conditions. The seminar blends theoretical inquiry with hands-on experimentation, emphasizing a bioregional approach—working with locally available materials, ecological processes, and environmental constraints to develop meaningful, responsive interventions.Throughout the semester, students will critically and creatively engage with precedents. Assignments include an individual investigation of specific environmental machines and a small-group project that develops and prototypes a performative, materially intelligent construct in response to a selected environmental condition. Central to our inquiry this semester will be the idea of material mechanisms: tools that work through material properties—for example, harnessing swelling, shrinking, bending, decay, or conductivity to perform environmental work. Possible projects might include, for example, erosion-control structures that support microhabitats in arid zones; damming constructs for filtering water to encourage habitat restoration, such as beaver re-wilding; or bio-habitats tailored to the needs of specific species.",,Graduate School of Design,,,Landscape Architecture,Project-based Seminar,In Person,GSD Graded,,,,

This course hypothesizes that only by being exposed to dozens of different ways to grapple with creating or transitioning a practice can someone begin to chart their own path. Apart from charting a path, practice is equally, if not more, about how one negotiates and reacts to unforeseeable opportunities and obstacles. Reaction is as important as action, and they are intimately intertwined. As the word denotes, practice is a form of constant learning and learning from real-time conditions, which the practitioner often cannot imagine beforehand. Only by addressing 'real world' market conditions does one learn the skills required to develop a robust practice and start to recognize the emergent market patterns that often define practice. The 'theory of practice,' especially concerning domains compelled to engage and create in the physical world, is a quizzical field of study. Attempting to 'teach' practice, a process that embodies learning through action, is to make academic something intended to be explored outside the hallowed walls of academia. The theory of how to swim is not the same as practicing swimming. An overly theorized approach to practice removes the student from the actual source of learning while indoctrinating an ideology often supporting the professionalization of practice over the exploration of emergent characteristics of practicing. This course is not about 'teaching' practice but instead learning from the experiences of a wide variety of guest practitioners to develop a broader definition of practice and a greater understanding of the types of contextual and self-imposed obstacles that exist, some of which are manageable while others prove insurmountable.",,Graduate School of Design,,,Landscape Architecture,Discussion-based Seminar,In Person,GSD Graded,,,,

Rooted in the varied contexts and motives of its programmatic evolution, the course equips students with tools to anticipate the art museum's typological trajectory amidst socio-economic, cultural, and environmental challenges. At stake is architecture's prerogative to enable the institution's relevance.The art museum has emerged as one of the most significant and prolific typologies of the last century. Its edifice is at once a vessel for our cultural memories and a platform for espousing values, ideas, and knowledge essential to navigating our collective futures. The museum building tethers the objects it houses to the public it hosts. The three - building, object, and public - are constantly in dynamic alignments and tension with one another.The course is divided into four sections. Origins of the Typology: Expands the discourse to include non-Mediterranean/Western antecedents, reflecting our shared urge to collect and display.The Gallery: Traces the evolution of the gallery - the primary space of display - and the corresponding evolution in art, educational frameworks, and sociocultural practices. The study of gallery types, from the palatial salon to the white box, to burgeoning contemporary strategies, lay bare the didactic relationship between architecture and objects. The Non-Gallery: Analyzes the roles of non-gallery programs - spaces of conservation and storage, circulation, infrastructure, retail, food, classrooms and auditoriums, among others - as mechanisms that expand the art museum’s relevance and economic viability, while providing alibis for architectural form.Future Trajectories: Anticipates new directions relative to contemporary issues such socio-economic inequity, cultural property, and the climate crisis.The course straddles art and architectural history, design, practice, exhibition, arts programming and operations, infrastructure, climate, economics, landscape, and curatorial practices.

Nevertheless, until the adoption of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD), the world's largest minority group was largely excluded from global human rights protection (e.g., UN human rights treaty work), global initiatives (notably the Millennium Development Goals), and national level law and policy programming, with the majority of States having internally uncoordinated health or social welfare initiatives. The CRPD has now been ratified by nearly all of the 193 UN Member States, making it the fastest ratified human rights treaty, and nearly universal in scope. Meanwhile, the MDGs successor program, the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) were adopted by consensus at the UN in 2016 and require the inclusion of persons with disabilities in their social transformation mandate. In consequence of these global schemes, States are struggling to develop coordinated and efficient national level programming for their disabled populations, until-now their typically neglected yet largest minority group. This course examines how States develop national level programming to include persons with disabilities across a variety of sectors including health, education, employment, community inclusion, and social welfare and development. Throughout the course we will examine critically the tension between human rights and their aspiration of full human flourishing and the constraints placed upon States by resource, social, cultural, and other limitations. The instructor participated in the negotiation of the CRPD and has since been involved in disability law, policy, and development initiatives in some forty-four countries. He has also been consulted by UN agencies on disability law and policy programming, including the SDGs, and will draw on these experiences when analyzing how States respond to their legal and policy obligations. We will be joined by a variety of guests with international experience who will help us contextualize how disability-related policy work is implemented on the ground.",No exam.

This for-credit module explores these questions in one of the world’s most dynamic regions: the Arabic-speaking Middle East. Throughout the Arab world, national leaders have declared a commitment to the remaking of their societies. National reform projects such as the United Arab Emirates’ “Vision 2021,” Saudi Arabia’s and Egypt’s “Vision[s] 2030,” Kuwait’s “Vision 2035,” and Oman’s “Vision 2040,” speak to a region-wide dissatisfaction with the current state of affairs, and an urgent impulse to change it. The module, which will take place in the United Arab Emirates, with potential visits to other Gulf countries, will enable students to explore these reform efforts firsthand, to place them into their broader global and historical context, and to assess their futures.

Police institutions are also the primary entity of the state with which most citizens come into direct contact. In practice, however, governments throughout the Americas (and beyond) have long struggled to organize police institutions such that they address societal demands for security, and that the deployment of coercion against citizens is applied equitably and constrained by law and external accountability. From São Paulo and Johannesburg to Chicago and Baltimore, police forces engage in widespread extrajudicial killings and torture that largely target marginalized sectors of society, including Afro-descendants, the poor, and those living in the urban periphery. At the same time, these groups are also underserved by their police – and the state – leaving them vulnerable to high rates of crime and violence.

Policymakers in the 21st century, from members of Congress to analysts and executives need to be equipped with the necessary skills to navigate nuanced issues at the intersection of technology and governance. Those who have first-hand experience with programming, data, software development and management methods, open source collaboration, and technology innovation are better prepared to competently navigate these issues. In the course of ten four-hour classes, this module will provide an intensive hands-on curriculum that involves programming exercises in the context of government and politics to build essential core technology and data skills. The hands on exercises will familiarize students with technologies that are a part of the modern programmers toolkit including the command-line, github, the structure of a web application, the linux filesystem, data standards (json, XML, etc), cloud technologies, and databases. This is not a data science course, nor is it a standard programming bootcamp. This course is designed to give students a deeper appreciation for the nuances of software and data through practical training. Though the course is rooted practical applications, students will be prompted through assigned readings and discussion to think broadly about the implications of implementing the technologies introduced and their ramifications in the context of policy. Exercises will build on one another so that students will come away with a small software project of their own. The course is also designed to prepare students who wish to pursue further learning to overcome the initial barrier to learning programming and more efficiently direct future efforts.",,Harvard Kennedy School,,,HKS Government,Lecture,In Person,HKS Letter Graded,,,,

The central objective of the New Climate Observatory is to address this problem by introducing, for the first time, the development of a new generation of innovative technology that takes explicit advantage of recent major advances in Harvard-based instruments and optical designs in combination with advanced solar powered stratospheric aeronautical design. The new solar powered stratospheric aircraft that together constitute the Climate Observatory engage multiple recent design innovations in photovoltaics, energy storage, as well as guidance and control. Together these enable a combination of long duration solar powered observing systems, each targeted at the highest priority risk factors that threaten global societal stability. The resulting observations will, for the first time, provide the irrefutable evidence needed for quantitative forecasts of the dominant risk factors stemming from the global use of fossil fuels.Important examples include the challenges of rapidly expanding wildfires in the western United States, the increasing rate of global sea level rise, the mechanisms controlling irreversible shifts in the large-scale (Brewer-Dobson) dynamical structure of the atmosphere, shifts in the drought patterns globally that trigger food shortages that in turn trigger refugee dislocation, as well as the mechanisms behind the loss of global fresh water supplies.While satellites have for years dominated the federal climate programs, for the purpose of developing tested and trusted quantitative forecasts of risk, satellites engender significant disadvantages. In sharp contrast to satellite systems, the new Harvard Climate Observatory provides, for the first time, orders of magnitude improvement in spatial and temporal resolution observations. ESE/EPS 166 will focus explicitly on this new generation of climate observations, forecasting, and resulting advances in public policy.

What are/were the epistemological and material vectors that constitute each word, and how do these vectors bridge the two terms, or conversely, bring them into them conflict? What specific modes of mapping the world have arisen from this combination?This undergraduate seminar sketches a trajectory of cinema as an art of formulating subjectivity in Korea, from the colonial period to the present. Bringing together multiple understandings of “technology”—in relation to mass media, natural science and engineering, and the operation of governmentality—we will probe how cinema has been a major site of technologies, a central node at which the fostering of pliant subjects for imperialism, authoritarianism, neoliberalism, and heteronormative male-centered society in general; the navigation and critique of these very power relations; and encounters with new science and mass media technologies all intersected in Korea. Instead of defining Korean cinema as the homogenous realization of some unchanging cultural essence of Korea, this seminar approaches it as a conjunction of diverse modes of addressing the subject’s place within the changing techno-geopolitical, infrastructural, and ecological landscapes surrounding Korea. In tandem with an in-depth reading of each film’s aesthetic and narrative features, we will examine the rationales behind the categorization of films as Joseon film, women’s film, experimental film, Minjok film, Korean New Wave, and Korean blockbusters, to name a few, as proposed by film directors, critics, scholars, film societies, and government institutions. The focus of the seminar is placed on these cinematic genres’ (1) approach to the medium of film, audience, and screening venue, (2) their resonance with social movements and theorizations of cinema abroad, (3) the convergence of film aesthetics and infrastructural changes (train, car, factory, etc.) and new media technologies (computer animation, VR, drone, GoPro, etc.), and (4) their frustration or consolidation of the national, ideological, gendered, and epochal boundaries propping up the notion of “Korean.” Building on these concerns, students are encouraged to explore the interplay of multiple technologies through which diverse forms of subjectivity are contested, questioned, and appropriated, and to respond to the central questions posed by the seminar in their final projects.",,Faculty of Arts & Sciences,,,East Asian Langs & Civ,Seminar,,FAS Letter Graded,,N/A,N/A,N/A

After identifying the intellectual stakes (week 1), and discussing anecdotal glimpses from the grassroot-levels (week 2), the class deals with traditional development assistance, along with Maoist attempts to revolutionize the “world countryside” – resulting in legacies such as a China-trained guerilla fighter serving as the President of Zimbabwe. We then discuss the current footprint of Beijing, including its influence on elite politics, Chinese public and private business interests, and the diversity of the one million Chinese migrants to Africa.

Children with Learning and Developmental Differences,EDST  125,Nadine Gaab,2026 Spring,Full Term,,,,,,12632,218922,Instructor,,,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,"The duration of education is a strong predictor of health and longevity, but approximately 1 in 5 children with learning or attention issues have long-lasting negative consequences related to their academic, social, mental health, vocational, economic outcomes. In the US, over 2 million students struggle with specific learning disabilities (SLD), which represents roughly 35% of all students who receive special education services under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act. Children with a learning disability are less likely to complete high school or enroll in postsecondary educational programs and have a heightened risk for developing mental health problems such as depression or anxiety. Currently, SLDs are primarily identified and addressed within the education system; however, these students also receive care and support outside of school and are members of various community settings. A streamlined approach that informs the coordination of general education, special education, clinical psychology, policymaking, advocacy, caregivers, and health professionals (e.g., pediatricians, speech-and language pathologists) is often absent and hinders the design of preventive approaches, identification strategies, and service implementation. It further leads to a siloed approach for care and policymaking, lack of community supports.The course will provide a broad overview of learning disabilities and differences, including dyslexia, dyscalculia, attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder, developmental language disorder, and autism spectrum disorder, as well as the relevant policies and educational documentation for these learners. It will then cover the professional stakeholders that should be involved in an evidence-based response to a learning difference, and identify their unique knowledge base, toolset, developmental timeline, and communication strategies, both in the educational/professional environment and the community. Finally, we will focus on barriers and challenges faced by children with learning differences in the academic, professional, and community settings. Throughout the course, students will be provided with both research/evidence-based content and case-based learning opportunities, practical examples, and guest speakers drawn from the community. Class activities will include both synchronous and asynchronous learning activities led by the Instructor (Prof. Nadine Gaab), along with breakout sessions overseen by the instructor and/or Teaching Fellows.This course is divided into thirds and will cover: (1) a broad overview of learning disabilities, educational policies, and service documentation; (2) stakeholders in academic and professional settings, including their unique knowledge base, toolset, developmental timeline, and communication strategies, barriers faced by children with learning differences in these settings, existing solutions to these barriers; and (3) stakeholders in community settings, barriers faced by individuals with learners in these settings, existing solutions to these challenges.",,Faculty of Arts & Sciences,,,Education Studies,Lecture,,FAS Letter Graded,,N/A,N/A,Social Sciences

For example, can psychology help to improve the way that we teach reading? Can it help to close the gap in achievement between particular groups? Do preschoolers have ideas or dispositions that help--or hinder--their progress in school? However, one can also ask about the effects of education on psychological processes. There is enormous cross-national and cross-cultural variation in the length and type of education that children receive. A major goal of this course is to help students understand the effects of such variation on the ways that people think--and feel. A secondary goal is to alert students to the ways in which those effects can be measured and to underline the contribution that different methods--experiments, large-scale surveys, and participant observation--can make to our understanding of such effects. The final goal is to underline how educational provision and its impact vary dramatically across the globe.Learning Goals:There is enormous variation in the length and type of education that children receive. A major goal of this course is to help you think about and understand the effects of such variation on the way that children end up thinking - and the values they hold.

When immersed in our own upbringing and educational experiences, we can easily take our beliefs and practices for granted, while overlooking cross-cultural variation and making inaccurate generalization about people from different backgrounds. That is why it is important to take a cross-cultural approach in the study of education. It not only helps us understand the diversity and universalities in educational practices around the world, but also invites us to see our own experiences in a new light and reflect on how our beliefs about learning, teaching, and parenting have been shaped by our cultural backgrounds. In this course, we will examine the interplay between education and culture, focusing on beliefs and practices in schools and families across various cultures. Specifically, we will investigate how cultural values and assumptions shape parent-child interactions, teacher-student dynamics, teaching and learning approaches, and educational systems.

Each section is a different design challenge. Students may apply to multiple sections, but preference will always be given to new students. In each intensive practicum, students will serve as design consultants to a business or nonprofit “client,” gaining hands-on experience developing a design proposal for a new product, delivery platform, or feature for an existing program. The client—an educational content provider or publisher—will provide background information on the market, educational goals, and operational aspects of an authentic design challenge, including potentially proprietary information. Under the guidance of the instructor, who has over 40 years of experience developing educational products, students will work in small teams to produce research-based product proposals. Completing robust weekly deliverables, with periodic feedback from the client, will be critical to meet the timing demands of a real world need. Expect rapid iteration on problem definition, underlying research, design constraints, evidence of impact, and targeted “minimum viable products” (MVPs).

Organizing, in turn, requires leadership: accepting responsibility for enabling others to achieve shared purpose in the face of uncertainty. Organizers ask three core questions:Who are my people? What is the change we need? How can we turn our resources into the power we need to achieve that change?Organizers learn to identify, recruit and develop leadership, build community with that leadership, and create power from resources of that community.This practicum has two modes.During the first part of the course, Campaign Design, students participate in an 18-day “courseshop”, bookended by two 2.5 day weekend workshops during the weekends of February 14th-16th & February 28th - March 2nd. Students learn with plenary lectures, small group practice and coaching. Requirements include consistent attendance, active participation, selected readings, a 600 word pre-module paper and a 700 word post-module  paper. In the 12 days between the two weekend workshops this module will require approximately 15 hours of work (one-to-ones with constituents, team meetings, and meetings with your Teaching Fellow).In the second half of the course, Campaign Leadership, students participate in plenary sessions on Tuesdays and in sections on Thursdays, from March 24th to May 2nd. In plenary, we focus on challenges that arise from running an organizing campaign, gain insights from cases, readings, lecture and discussion. In section, we coach each team’s practice leading their campaign as they meet new challenges and discover new opportunities.  You will learn not only “about” these practices.  You will learn to practice them experientially, coach others in the practice, and receive coaching yourself.  We encourage a “growth mindset” for this practicum: try new things, take some risks, ask new questions.This practicum is for students interested in learning to create social change through collective action. There are no prerequisites to enroll in the course. Students with and without “real world” organizing experience can find the class equally useful. Students with a strong commitment to the community, organization, or values on behalf of which they are working will be most successful. Because it is a course in practice, it requires trying new things, risking failure, and stepping outside one’s comfort zone. As reflective practitioners, students learn through critical reflection on their experience, feedback, and coaching.

In particular, how values embedded in key global educational reports and policies have shaped interventions aimed at addressing the global ‘learning crisis’ in Africa, and why these interventions are failing to deliver promised results. It will examine how the deficit characterisation of the African child and teacher has been used to drive teaching and learning interventions/reforms undermining African children’s agentic learning and the professional practice of teachers.Sessions will also explore the often overlooked but fundamental issue of the language of instruction in basic education in sub-Saharan Africa and other global Southern school settings.

It seeks to provide you with an approach to help you: (a) diagnose the underlying reasons for existing challenges in education in LMICs; (b) assess the promise and potential pitfalls of proposed solutions; (c) design policies and programs with greater chances of success; and (d) monitor and/or evaluate the consequences of new or existing efforts. The course is intended for master’s and doctoral students seeking to apply insights from economics to policy design, analysis, and monitoring/evaluation. It draws on theory and evidence from labor, development, and behavioral economics. It focuses on pre-primary to secondary education—the levels in which enrollments have expanded most rapidly in LMICs.This course is structured around four main parts. The first one aims to make you view education in LMICs through the eyes of economists (Why do they study education? How do they view education? What do they think are the main challenges in education in LMICs?). This part is essential for you to understand why economists study certain questions and not others and the perspective from which they approach such questions. The second and third parts synthesize the evidence produced by economists in recent decades to improve both the “quantity” (e.g., enrollment) and “quality” (e.g., learning) of education (How can we increase the share of the population that attends school? How can we improve the quality and relevance of instruction that students receive at school?). These parts constitute the core of the course, integrating economic theory and existing evidence. The fourth and final part identifies the main challenges in translating evidence into policy (How can we make sense of “bundled” interventions? How can we assess the relevance of evidence across contexts?) and offers an overview of the frontier in evidence generation.Prerequisites: You are expected to have taken EVI-101 (“Evidence”) and S-040 (“Introduction to Applied Data Analysis”) or equivalent courses that introduce students to regression analysis.

The course will begin by looking at CRT's roots in critical legal studies. The course will then explore CRT's more recent applications in the realm of education, which has its roots in examining the experiences of African Americans and others society deems as Black. In doing so, students will confront the intra- and interpersonal challenges and strengths of multiple socially constructed race groups by examining the branches of CRT that focus on people of color, including Latinos, Asians, and Indigenous peoples, and the use of CRT to examine Whiteness.

However, approximately one in five children with learning or attention-related challenges experience enduring impacts on their academic achievement, social interactions, mental health, vocational prospects, and socioeconomic opportunity. In the United States alone, more than two million students are identified with specific learning disabilities (SLD), comprising about 35% of students receiving special education services under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA). These students are statistically less likely to graduate from high school or pursue postsecondary education and are at increased risk for mental health concerns such as anxiety and depression.Although the educational system primarily identifies and supports children with learning differences, these students also interact with a wide range of professionals, caregivers, and community institutions. Unfortunately, the lack of integrated efforts across education, healthcare, policy, and community services often results in fragmented, siloed care, hindering early identification, whole-child intervention, and long-term support.This interdisciplinary course offers a comprehensive overview of learning disabilities and differences—such as dyslexia, dyscalculia, dysgraphia, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, developmental language disorder, and autism spectrum disorder—as well as the policies and documentation processes that shape educational services for these children.Students will explore the wide array of stakeholders involved in supporting children with learning differences, including educators, clinicians, health professionals, caregivers, policy advocates, and community members.

The responsibility for creating atmospheric CO2 is not shared across the world’s populations or successive generations and yet it has wrought environmental injustice impacting the most vulnerable populations and has created intractable challenges for young people and future generations. How we teach about climate change is critical to our response as a global population. Educators adopt a longitudinal view on the outcomes of their daily efforts—guiding each generation with hope and possibility. How do we communicate with urgency despite the uncertainties in the exact outcomes even while we are certain that climate change is real and is happening around us? How do we communicate the loss of what might be called a pact between the generations to the next generation? What can we do to ""get it right"" and to live sustainably on a changing planet? This course offers an intensive opportunity to explore issues related to teaching climate change in K-12. It invites a series of conversations about the following topics: 1) How do scientists explain the dynamics of climate change and what are some of the challenges in learning the science concepts?; 2) How does attending to climate change fit with what is known about the cognitive and emotional architecture of human minds and what are the implications for instruction?; 3) What are ways of knowing and being in relation with Earth and nature that respect the connectedness, systems dynamics, and language of nature.

Typically, scholarship on the first Americans—and Africans and their descendants—are studied in isolation. Dominant trends in scholarship, journals, academic disciplines, and university departments tend to reinforce these boundaries. And yet, from the dawn of European colonization to the present day, the worlds of Black and Indigenous peoples have collided in ways that have shaped not only the history of each group, but also, European empires, the United States, and the Atlantic World. The legacy of this past is one that lingers. In this seminar we will study the distinct and shared experiences of people of Indigenous and African descent. Within the broader context of Euro-American expansion, war, colonialism, and global capitalism, we will investigate:The historical relationship of Native peoples to land—and African-descended peoples to labor. We will then develop a broader perspective on dispossession and slavery by examining the shared experiences of Black and Native peoples. On the one hand, we will study slavery as an institution that included Indigenous Americans, predominantly as slaves, but also, as enslavers. We will also examine land loss as a historical phenomena that impacted Black Indians and Black Americans.The history of alliance and antagonism between Indigenous Americans and African Americans will provide another layer of analysis. It forms yet another dimension of the intersecting and shared experiences of both groups. Sometimes, Black and Indigenous peoples were allies in war and resistance, more generally; in other instances, they were antagonists. For decades, Indigenous Southerners enslaved people of African descent. While studying these contradictory relationships, we will also study the formation of mixed racial categories and identities. In this section of class we will focus on the lives and experiences of Black Indians. Key subjects and themes include: Euro-American imperialism; settler colonialism; dispossession; chattel slavery; (racial) capitalism; the Atlantic World; Indian enslavement and Indian enslavers; race, racism, and the formation of racial categories; the contradictory nature of Black-Indian relationships; Black-Indians and mixed-race identities; American state formation and contemporary state violence; emancipation and sovereignty. Course material will draw from classic and groundbreaking works across several disciplines, including Native American and Indigenous Studies, African American Studies, Black & Native histories; the law.

Technical Knowledge: The use of rigorous system engineering methods to plan, design, develop, build, and test a complex technology-based product/service, integrating knowledge across diverse engineering disciplines. And Business Knowledge: The use of lean experimentation methods to develop and test a set of hypotheses that capture how the new product/service will create value, including business model design, customer value proposition, go to market (GTM) strategy, operating model and profit formula.The Capstone comprises two related courses. The first course – Launch Lab 1 – is an immersive course completed over a 2-week period in January of the EC year (Capstone I).

The Sprint process has been widely adopted by startups and large corporations and is a key technique for aspiring product managers. In the second week, teams develop an “Investor Pitch” for a business model that surrounds the new product/service concept they are working on.

The Black Lyric,ENGLISH  173BL,Tracy K.

And yet, from its earliest iterations, African American poetry has also concerned itself with correcting and complicating the official narrative of Black life and Black subjectivity in America. This course will explore the means by which Black poets have innovated upon the lyric tradition to accommodate a sense of allegiance to a collective. In this tradition, the lyric poem has become a powerful tool with which to ponder the dynamics of self and other, intimate and political—and justice and injustice. Course readings will include work by seminal 20th Century American figures such as Langston Hughes, Gwendolyn Brooks, Robert Hayden and Lucille Clifton, as well as contemporary voices like Jericho Brown, Tyehimba Jess, Morgan Parker, Eve L.

From the heroic poems of the ancient Near East to modern films of quest and adventure, epic speaks to the shared values and collective aspirations of cultures, peoples, and communities. But if its formal conventions and thematic interests endure, epic changes over time. In this course, you will study the historical and literary evolution of epic as it moves from oral verse into new genres and media, reading texts from the ancient Mediterranean alongside works of poetry, fiction, and cinema from early modern Britain, twentieth-century America, and the contemporary Global South. We will look at some texts in their entirety and others in extracts, focusing on Homer’s Iliad and Odyssey, Vergil’s Aeneid, Milton’s Paradise Lost, Derek Walcott’s Omeros, The Mahabharata (in prose and film versions), and George Lucas’ Star Wars, with detailed analysis of Gwendolyn Brooks’s American epics on Black life, Annie Allen and In the Mecca.

Austen’s achievement helped to transform the genre, helping establish fiction as the form that (paradoxically enough) explains reality and as the form that explains us to ourselves. In this class we'll read all six of Austen’s novels and study the contribution they made to the remaking of modern fiction. Though our emphasis will fall on these works’ place in the literary culture of Austen’s day and on their historical contexts in an era of political, social, and literary revolution, we’ll also acknowledge the strong and ardent feelings that Austen’s oeuvre continues to arouse today. To that end, we’ll do some investigating of the frequently wild world of contemporary Austen fandom and the Austenian tourism, shopping, adaptations, and sequels that nurture it. At the same time, we’ll also remember that Austen knew fandom from both sides; part of our work this semester will be to learn about the early-nineteenth-century cultures of literary appreciation in which Austen both enrolled the heroines of her fiction and enrolled herself.",,Faculty of Arts & Sciences,,,English,Lecture,,FAS Letter Graded,,N/A,N/A,Arts and Humanities

And yet despite the fact that all students write essays, most students rarely study them; bookshops and libraries categorize such work only negatively, by what it is not: “non-fiction.” At the same time, the essay is at present one of the most productive and fertile of literary forms. It is practiced as memoir, reportage, diary, criticism, and sometimes all four at once. Novels are becoming more essayistic, while essays are borrowing conventions and prestige from fiction. This class will disinter the essay from its comparative academic neglect, and examine the vibrant contemporary borderland between the reported and the invented. We will study the history of the essay, from Montaigne to the present day. Rather than study that history purely chronologically, each class will group several essays from different decades and centuries around common themes: death, detail, sentiment, race, gender, photography, the city, witness, and so on. In addition to writing about essays – writing critical essays about essays – students will also be encouraged to write their own creative essays: we will study the history of the form, and practice the form itself.

Before the Novel: Medieval Romance,ENGLISH   90MC,Nicholas Watson,2026 Spring,Full Term,,,,,,17116,226410,Instructor,,,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,"Medieval romances are ancestors of the modern novel, including the psychological novel and the fictions we call “fantasy.” In modern French, the word “roman” means “novel.” In this course, we read a series of romances from England and elsewhere written between the twelfth century, when this baggy genre developed, and the fifteenth century, when it entered the age of print. We consider why romances came into being where and when they did, where they found their basic ingredients—imagined worlds, protagonists, “adventures,” and the “marvels” that are the genre’s special spice—and how they shaped and were shaped by the rapidly-changing culture in which they were written. We also reflect on the purposes they served, which extended well beyond straightforward entertainment. Like novels, romances set out to create solidarity, articulating common values, defining in-groups against out-groups, laying out rules for competition and cooperation, and modeling that mix of ethics and manners that is a hallmark of “polite” societies. But they also question what it means to live in such a society and test the fault lines of the ideals and attitudes that underlie it, sometimes to breaking-point—exploring the experimental space opened up by the genre’s greatest invention, the mode of invented narration we call “fiction.” They pay particular attention to the tensions between sacred and secular, public valor and private desire, family origin and socio-economic status, as well as to the dynamics between king and subject, gender roles and gendered performance, elite and non-elite. While they often take the form of the bildungsroman, narrating the difficulties involved in fashioning the lives of individuals or couples, they can also depict the rise and fall of entire societies. In the first half of the course, we read (translated) texts originally written in French, including a number by two, remarkable women writers, Marie de France and Clemence of Barking, both of them from England and exploring how romances interact with other genres, including chronicle histories, saint’s lives, and lyrics. In the second, we move to texts written in Middle English, which we read in the original language (not difficult; no previous experience necessary), including Thomas Malory’s Morte d’Arthur and the great Sir Gawain and the Green Knight.

This introductory course is limited to the setting where interest is in a causal effect of a time-fixed treatment on either a continuous or binary outcome.  The material is generally split into two parts separated by two different types of causal assumptions. Part I will focus on reasoning under the assumption that all required confounders are measured in the data to be analyzed. Two types of statistical methods that may be justified for causal effect estimation under this reasoning will be introduced in Part I, standardization and inverse-probability weighting, where students will also learn to understand and reason critically about parametric model assumptions in the context of high dimensional confounding adjustment. Part II will focus on reasoning under alternative causal assumptions that do not require that all confounders are measured. In this case it is, instead, required that a so-called instrumental variable (IV) can be leveraged for causal inference.

The central objective of the New Climate Observatory is to address this problem by introducing, for the first time, the development of a new generation of innovative technology that takes explicit advantage of recent major advances in Harvard-based instruments and optical designs in combination with advanced solar powered stratospheric aeronautical design. The new solar powered stratospheric aircraft that together constitute the Climate Observatory engage multiple recent design innovations in photovoltaics, energy storage, as well as guidance and control. Together these enable a combination of long duration solar powered observing systems, each targeted at the highest priority risk factors that threaten global societal stability. The resulting observations will, for the first time, provide the irrefutable evidence needed for quantitative forecasts of the dominant risk factors stemming from the global use of fossil fuels. Important examples include the challenges of rapidly expanding wildfires in the western United States, the increasing rate of global sea level rise, the mechanisms controlling irreversible shifts in the large-scale (Brewer-Dobson) dynamical structure of the atmosphere, shifts in the drought patterns globally that trigger food shortages that in turn trigger refugee dislocation, as well as the mechanisms behind the loss of global fresh water supplies. While satellites have for years dominated the federal climate programs, for the purpose of developing tested and trusted quantitative forecasts of risk, satellites engender significant disadvantages. In sharp contrast to satellite systems, the new Harvard Climate Observatory provides, for the first time, orders of magnitude improvement in spatial and temporal resolution observations. ESE/EPS 166 will focus explicitly on this new generation of climate observations, forecasting, and resulting advances in public policy.

This seminar will examine and interrogate both literary and journalistic dimensions of medical writing. The investigation will be chronological, beginning with “classic” narratives by Tolstoy, Chekhov, and Kafka, and then moving on to more contemporary authors such as William Carlos Williams, Richard Selzer, Oliver Sacks, Susan Sontag, and Philip Roth. Controversial and contentious subjects are sought in these writings: the imbalance of power between physician and patient; how different religions frame the genesis and outcome of disease; the role of quackery, avarice, and ego in molding doctors’ behavior; whether character changes for better or worse when people face their mortality; what is normal and what is abnormal behavior based on culture, neuroscience, and individual versus group norms. The presentation of illness in journalism will be studied in selected readings from the New York Times’ and Boston Globe’s Science sections, as well as periodicals like the New Yorker, The New York Review of Books, Harper’s, and the Atlantic Monthly.

These included medical crimes, which, thus far, are the most thoroughly documented examples of ethical transgressions of health care professionals. They include forced sterilizations, the “euthanasia” systematic patient murder program, and forced brutal medical experiments on the living and the dead. However, under conditions of oppression by the same political system, some health care professionals chose to retain the healing powers of medicine.Anatomy in Nazi Germany is an example of ethical transgressions in the medical sciences that reveals the complex relationships between scientists and the Nazi regime. Changes of the traditional anatomical body procurement manifested in the use of many bodies of Nazi victims in teaching and scientific investigations. Research gradually moved from routine studies to murder, from the anatomy lab to the Nazi prison system and then to the concentration camps. Ultimately, anatomists were complicit with the government through their role in the complete destruction of the perceived “enemies” of the Nazi regime.This history of medicine can thus serve as a model for the recognition of patterns and common roots with other histories of discrimination, oppression, and atrocities. Also, there are continuities and legacies from this history that reach into the present and have relevance for today’s education and practice in the health professions.","To students interested in applying to FYSEMR 23H: Medicine in Nazi Germany and the Holocaust—Your application to this seminar should state your interest and previous exposure to this topic.

The seminar will start with a consideration of general themes and then move to a chronologic perspective. First, we approach child development as a dynamic force, one which simultaneously engages multiple domains: social/relational, cognitive, physical, moral. We will then switch to examine stages of development in sequence, using our understanding of neurobiological, physical, cultural, and psychological factors to inform our assessment of how children change over time.

Or is death instead final, in the sense that it causes me to cease existing altogether?

Yes, writing is a deliberate and emotional process… but not one which has to be necessarily painstaking. What if, first and foremost, writing was fun? This is the question we’ll explore and enact while getting to know our fellow classmates in this generative, art-oriented freshman seminar. We’ll read obscure yet celebrated writers whose work is distinctly wild, unconventional, compassionate, and opaque. In addition, each week we’ll create both individually and together, engaging methods of writing across a variety of forms – from gaming and poetry to food and stage plays – to reacquaint ourselves with the weird joys of what it might mean to craft ourselves creatively, personally, politically, and collaboratively with one another.

How has control over oil—the single most important commodity in the world—shaped the nature of power, politics, and environmental and social life in the twentieth century? How have different disciplines contributed to and at times undermined a critical understanding of oil politics? This interactive seminar will address these and other questions by examining the political, social, material, and cultural history of oil. Given the centrality of oil to modern life, control over this prized resource has resulted in a complex and often violent history. We will thus look at the ways in which the political economy of oil has shaped the rise and fall of empires, the fate of nation-states, the making of the economy, the nature of class, gender, and racial discrimination, and the production of historical knowledge and the built urban environment. By moving between primary source documents and films, multi-disciplinary scholarly analyses, in-class discussions and debates, and written assignments, students will learn to be principal investigators and thereby sharpen their own critical interpretive abilities.

On Peace and Protest,FYSEMR   63N,Homi Bhabha,2026 Spring,Full Term,,,,,,17748,216104,Instructor,,,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,"This seminar is attuned to the times we live in while addressing universal concerns of human life and historical experience. The relationship between “peace” and “protest” is essential to the dynamic of democracy. Peace is a necessary political condition for ensuring progress in a fair and just society; it is a shield against the violence and wastage of war. Democratic ideals and institutions are perennially at risk of corruption and decline, at which point “keeping the peace” gives rise to authoritarian policies and policing that threaten fundamental freedoms, rights, and liberties. In such critical conditions, “protest” is an instrument of collective dissent enacted by the “people” (variously defined) to restore their rights and freedoms. The movement-politics initiated by minority groups around the world against systematic disadvantage and discrimination have been pushed to protest when other channels of democratic dialogue have failed. Just as peace “at all costs” often leads to the death of democracy, protest “at all costs” might vitiate the political “goods” and virtues that it seeks to establish. How do we walk the political tightrope between “peace and protest”? How do we establish moral frameworks of negotiation rather than negation? This seminar will approach these questions through the humanistic disciplines of literature, philosophy, art and politics. Literary fictions and protest speeches will be as important to our class conversations as political theory and social media. We will emphasize the intersections between disciplines, and loosen the boundaries between bodies of knowledge, to reveal humanistic spaces of dialogue and action from which we might reach a better understanding of the complex, often contradictory, relationships between peace and protest.",,Faculty of Arts & Sciences,,,First Year Seminar Program,Seminar,,FAS Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory,Course open to First-Year Students Only,N/A,N/A,None

This assumption shapes contemporary anxieties about political misinformation, conspiracy theories, and ideological polarization. But what if democracy has never really worked that way?

Voters lack basic political knowledge, interpret facts through partisan lenses, and rely on intuition. At the same time, democracy has persisted despite never quite living up to its own ideals.This seminar explores how public opinion actually works, rethinking what it means to “know” in democratic politics. To do so, this seminar bridges two approaches that are often considered separately: political theory, which asks what democracy ought to be, and empirical research, which studies how people actually make political decisions. Each side has something to learn from the other: theory challenges assumptions embedded in public opinion research; empirical findings push theorists to grapple with real political behavior.Readings will range from pragmatist philosophy to media studies, from classic public opinion research to contemporary debates about misinformation and expertise.

Evolving Morality: From Primordial Soup to Superintelligent Machines,GENED 1046,Joshua Greene,2026 Spring,Full Term,,,,,,13089,203129,No Consent,,,False,True,False,True,False,False,False,"How can we understand the evolution of morality—from primordial soup to superintelligent machines—and how might the science of morality equip us to meet our most pressing moral challenges?In this course we’ll examine the evolution of morality on Earth, from its origins in the biology of unthinking organisms, through the psychology of intelligent primates, and into a future inhabited by machines that may be more intelligent and better organized than humans. First, we ask: What is morality? Many people believe that morality descends from above, as divine commands or as abstract, timeless principles akin to mathematical truths. Here we take an empirical approach to morality, viewing it as a natural phenomenon that rises up from below—born of the strategic interactions among lifeforms and societies struggling to exist. Next, we take a scientifically informed look at the foundational questions of moral and political philosophy. Many people believe that the “is” of scientific knowledge has nothing to do with the fundamental “oughts” of morality, that science and morality exist in separate realms (and belong in separate courses). Here we challenge this assumption, asking whether our scientific self-knowledge can, and should, change our views about what’s right and wrong and how a society should be organized. Finally, we consider the distinctive moral challenges posed by what may be the next stage in Earth’s evolutionary history: the rise of artificial intelligence. Many people believe that there is and always will be a fundamental division between human minds and machines. Here we challenge this assumption, going beyond the tropes of science fiction and drawing instead on the latest advances in cognitive neuroscience and neurally inspired artificial intelligence. Our conclusions will have implications for moral challenges of the near and more distant future: Can self-driving cars, military drones, and life-like robots be programmed to behave morally? Will artificial intelligence displace human labor? If so, how can our societies adapt? Could machines displace humans entirely? If so, how can we stay in control? If machines do take over, will they be our conquerors or our children?

This course aims to teach you how to manage argument and persuasion in your own life – not just with skill, but ethically. Accordingly, we will have two main goals. The first is to develop your skill at recognizing the myriad ways in which language can be used and misused as a tool for persuasion, by teaching you a variety of techniques drawn from formal logic, linguistics, and the discipline of argument-mapping. Master this skill, and anytime someone attempts to persuade you of something, you will be able to understand the structure of their attempt so deeply that you need not fear manipulation, but can decide for yourself whether you wish to sign on to the conclusion they want you to reach. Our second goal is even more important: we hope to show you how you can – and why you should – construct your own arguments with such clarity, honesty, and logical transparency that the people you direct them to will be optimally placed to decide, for themselves, whether and why they ought to agree with you. In this way, you will come to see argument not primarily as a contest to be won or lost, but as something that should be reclaimed for a more noble purpose: building genuine understanding between people, even across profound differences of viewpoint.",,Faculty of Arts & Sciences,,,General Education,Lecture,,FAS Letter Graded,Course open to Undergraduate Students Only,Ethics and Civics,N/A,None

We will discuss issues ranging from formal aesthetics to historical representation, from local film industries to transnational audience reception.This course does not assume prior knowledge of East Asian culture or of film studies, but rather seeks to provide students with a basic understanding of modern East Asian cultural history through cinema, and with an essential toolkit for analyzing film and media, including narrative, cinematography, editing and sound. In addition to critical approaches, students are strongly encouraged to creatively respond to course materials by collaborating on their own short films, beginning with the illustration of film terms in the first two weeks and culminating in the “Golden Monkey Awards”—a class screening of final projects with Oscar-like awards in various categories.As a General Education course, East Asian Cinema will help students develop aesthetic responsiveness and interpretive ability to moving images in an increasingly media-saturated world. While becoming acquainted with some analytical vocabulary and critical approaches to cinema, students will also gain insights into East Asian cultures and histories, aesthetic traditions and ethical values, as well as the politics and economics that went into the films’ production and reception.

Many agree that it sets us apart as a species—but does it? What is creativity? How have humans made sense of it across centuries and cultures, and what role might it play in our lives today? Exploring creativity takes us into the very question of what makes us human, and the answers we discover can help equip us for the lives we will lead beyond the classroom. This course casts a wide net, crossing disciplines as it takes us from ancient treatises on the art of poetic composition to modern brain scans, and from centuries-old debates over intellectual property to present-day questions of artificial intelligence. Is creativity the same as originality? Can plagiarism be creative? Should one own the fruits of one’s creative labor? What happens in the brain at moments of creative insight? Can creativity be “hacked”? We will hear directly from practicing artists and experts as we explore these questions through regular, small-stakes creative experiments and a creative final project.

Or a digital text on a screen? Why does the physical book persist in the digital age? To answer these questions, we will study the many different material forms in which texts in Western culture have been inscribed—from tablets to e-books—and the technologies that have enabled their creation. We will also explore every possible aspect of the object we know as a “book,” from the title page to the index, and from the layout of a page to the use of illustrations and decorations—and what each of these features of the book can tell us about its historical role, how readers have used the book, and what it has meant to them.

Through direct purchase and through the collecting activity of numerous alumnae/i, we began collecting all sorts of texts and artifacts generated by the medieval world of Arabic, Greek, and Latin civilizations. The things that arrived in Harvard’s collections came in many forms, ranging from great architectural monuments and motifs to little stuff such as belt buckles, pilgrims’ flasks, and fragments of pottery. Why did we want medieval stuff? And what have we since learned about the world from which it came? This is a course about objects and their meaning, focusing on the objects in Harvard’s collections that derive from western Eurasia and North Africa between the fall of the Roman Empire to the eve of contact with the New World. The five modules in the course begin by introducing you to five objects—things, images, texts—in Harvard’s collections. Each of these objects lies on the edges of canonical knowledge and therefore pose mysteries and invite questions. Our own exploration starts with the context of the object’s acquisition and briefly explores what was happening in the world at the moment of its arrival. What did the acquisition of the medieval mean a hundred years ago? From there, we plunge into the past to explore the objects in their own context, working to grasp technologies, economies, social relations, and beliefs. Among other topics, we explore how medieval people imagined saints, miracles and witchcraft, as well as hell and other nasty regions of the afterworld. We explore trade networks and power structures and beliefs about others. We see how medieval peoples mapped visions of their own world, and work our way into the deep inner structures of their cognition, such as their understandings of time and calendar. Starting from the particular and moving to the general, lectures and assignments seek to frame the cultural context of each object and model how students can develop the skills they need to unpack and explain the unfamiliar. A major course-long assignment will invite students to make their own discoveries in Harvard’s collections and elsewhere and to curate their own virtual gallery of objects that engages with the medieval world.

The emphasis is on the mythical and social origins, glory days and political collapse of the Aztec Empire and Maya civilizations as a pivot to the study of the sexual, religious and racial interactions of the Great Encounter between Mesoamerica, Africa, Europe, and the independent nations of Mexico and the United States. The study of the archaeology, artistic media, cosmovision, capital cities, human sacrifice and the religious devotions of ancient Mesoamerica illuminate the Day of the Dead and Virgin of Guadalupe phenomena today.

Based on the ancient artform of tragedy, this musical provokes its audiences to reflect on very modern concerns; it also, as the show’s creator Anaïs Mitchell says, “lets us cry.” This course is about how and why ancient Greek tragedy provides such a powerful lens for exploring some of today’s most pressing sociopolitical issues.

How different are we from foreigners? Or what happens to the victims of war? 2500 years later, ancient Greek tragedy is all around us, from Broadway to hip hop to Game of Thrones to TV advertisements. Its adaptations can expose forms of inequity: Luis Alfaro’s play Oedipus el Rey, for example, highlights incarceration rates among Latinx communities in 21st-century America. They can examine recent historical events that have fundamentally affected our understandings of race, conflict, and immigration, from Apartheid and the Truth and Reconciliation Commission in South Africa (Yaël Farber’s Molora) to the ongoing civil war in Syria (Queens of Syria). They can also provide models for explorations of identity—as we can see when Freddie Mercury becomes Dionysus in Queen’s iconic video for “I Want to Break Free.” In this course you will read, watch, and listen to some of the most recent reincarnations of ancient Greek tragedies alongside the original plays.

So convincing were they that one important character created by a Russian author of the nineteenth century was led to express the idea (if not exactly the words), ""if there is no God, all is permitted."" In more recent times some thinkers have challenged this assumption, and insisted that removing (or reducing) the role of God is indispensable to proper moral discourse. This course will examine the ways in which a concept of God has informed Western moral discourse, trying to help students engage the literature as they confront the basic question, why might one think ""if there is no God, all is permitted?"" and why might one think if there is a God human moral achievement is diminished or impossible. Further, we will examine ways in which the differing paradigms actually affect the moral conclusions we might generate.Belief in God and denial of God's existence have each figured prominently in Western moral discourse. Arguments have been advanced that: autonomous human reasoning is incapable of arriving at moral truths without a supreme principle to ground the system (which is sometimes invested with ""personality"" and called God); that autonomous human reasoning can have no impact on moral behavior due to human failure that only God can ""correct""; that autonomous moral reasoning is impossible, and morality can only be understood as the submission to the will of a superior moral being; that a concept of God is necessary to direct and regulate moral reasoning, but the actual confessional versions of theism are metaphysically implausible or impossible; that autonomous human moral reasoning is impossible with God, and thus only a-theism can lead to moral conclusions.

As a taxpayer, voter, or parent, you will be connected with formal schooling. You will almost certainly be in the role of teacher at various points in your life, whether in a classroom, in another professional setting, or guiding someone in something you love to do. Leaders in any field are teachers and coaches--they develop the people around them to bring their full potential to some shared ambition. You will also be in the role of learner throughout your life in a variety of forms and contexts. Precisely because we are all learners and teachers and we’ve all had some direct experience with K-12 schools, everyone has interests and opinions about schools. Yet, U.S. K-12 schools are consistently failing to serve all children well. This course will prepare you to recognize the assumptions, binaries, and controversies that drive much of the sound and substance of U.S. K-12 education, and replace those with a different ABCs: awareness, both-and thinking, and context. Learning can get lost in all the noise of education. What would it look like to make schools less about achievement and attainment and more about learning--and what can be your contribution, no matter your future pathways?",,Faculty of Arts & Sciences,,,General Education,Lecture,,FAS Letter Graded,Course open to Undergraduate Students Only,Ethics and Civics,N/A,None

By analyzing texts from Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm’s influential collection Children’s and Household Tales, comparing them to similar fairy tales from other cultures, and examining the contributions of visual artists to these transformations, we will explore pressing human questions such as love and desire, infertility and procreation, trust and betrayal, hunger and abundance, parental guidance and child abuse, and the discriminatory practices embedded in these texts, and demonstrate the universality and particularity of such stories and their impact on society at large. By the end of this course, you will have a thorough understanding of fairy tale archetypes and plot structures, various scholarly perspectives on these tales, an awareness of intertextuality, and the ability to analyze stories with multiple layers of meaning.

One of our technologies, computers, possesses a dizzying capability of acquiring, transmitting and processing massive amounts of data. Harnessing this resource requires a new form of inquiry: Computing. Computing is transforming our Thinking for solving complex problems and it is fueling the Artificial Intelligence (AI) revolution that is changing our world. This course is a guided exploration of how AI and Computing may affect our Thinking and aims to assist students to acquire the skills that computers do not possess. These include formulating problems and questions while understanding algorithmic powers and limitations and reflecting on the complementarity of artificial and natural intelligence. The course will introduce you to elementary algorithmic and programming concepts, discuss data driven and first principle models, argue about evidence, uncertainty and decision making aided by computing and AI. You will leave this course better prepared to assess the role of AI and Computing in society and technology and become more aware of the vehicles that will empower your journey into AI and Computing that may change the future definition of “Sapiens”.",,Faculty of Arts & Sciences,,,General Education,Lecture,,FAS Letter Graded,Course open to Undergraduate Students Only,Science and Technology in Society,N/A,None

Centered on a broad, enduring question about writing’s role in society, students engage with materials from literature, art history, history of the book, linguistic anthropology, archaeology, and philosophy. By using materials that are both immediate to, and yet distant from, students’ lives, the course seeks to enhance students’ aesthetic and interpretive understanding of the world, to provide students with an understanding of the social and historical contexts for the development of various technologies related to the production, transmission, and refabrication of the written word in association with power in a variety of ways. By exploring everything from urban graffiti and online protests to ancient tombs and Buddhist temples to petroglyphs and white-paper protests, students will analyze writing’s impact on identity, authority, spirituality, and artistic expression and learn through field works and hands-on experiences such as visits to Harvard’s East Asian collections and workshops on calligraphy and ink-making. The course encourages reflection on how writing mediates power and social change, offering insights into both historical and contemporary practices. All students are invited to think beyond nation-centered and Eurocentric models, developing a nuanced understanding of writing as both art and technology. The course equips students to think critically about the role of writing in an age shaped by generative AI and large language models.

Philosophy of Technology: From Marx and Heidegger to Artificial Intelligence,GENED 1194,Mathias Risse,2026 Spring,Full Term,,,,,,14319,224387,No Consent,,,False,True,False,True,False,False,False,"Is technology good, bad, or neutral – and if good, should we make it central to solving all our problems; if bad, should we radically change our ways; and if neutral, then what else should be the focus as we look for solutions to global problems?Technology shapes how power is exercised in society, and thereby also shapes how the present changes into the future. Technological innovation is all around us, and new possibilities in fields like artificial intelligence, genome-editing and geoengineering not only reallocate power, but might transform human life itself considerably, to the point of modifying the essence of what it is to be human. While ethical considerations enter prominently, the philosophy of technology is broader than its ethics. It aims to interpret and critically assess the role of technology for human life and guide us to a more thoughtful integration of technology in our individual lives and in public decision making. This course aims to teach you to do just that, starting with basic stances and key figures in the field and then progressing towards a number of challenges around specific types of technology as they arise for the 21st century. At times it is tech optimism that dominates these debates (sometimes even techno-boosterism that sees technology as key to heaven on earth), at other times it is more low-spirited attitudes from Romantic uneasiness to doom-and-gloom Luddism and technology-bashing. A closer look at these attitudes – alongside reflection on how technology and power are intertwined – will help generate a more skeptical attitude towards all of them and contribute to more level-headed debates, which are badly needed.",,Faculty of Arts & Sciences,,,General Education,Lecture,,FAS Letter Graded,Course open to Undergraduate Students Only,Ethics and Civics,N/A,None
Unity and Division,GENED 1202,Ryan Enos,2026 Spring,Full Term,,,,,,16053,226303,Instructor,,,False,False,True,False,True,False,False,"How can diverse societies be successful?Diversity is a fundamental problem and fundamental advantage of the human condition. If humans were all the same, free of identity, ideology, or culture, then many social scourges—prejudice, discrimination, perhaps even some violent conflict—would be dramatically reduced, if not eliminated. But with diversity also comes the wonderful variation that allows for the forces of evolution and innovation to better societies. In response to this tension, humans have created institutions to manage diversity by regulating conflict and reconciling differences of opinion. Politics is the process of navigating these difference managing institutions. The problem of politics then is the problem of diversity.Drawing on the disciplines of political science, psychology, economics, and philosophy, this course examines the question of how diverse societies and institutions can be successful. The course ultimately aims to provide students with the tools to be informed citizens and leaders in a diverse society.In the first part of the course, we start with the psychology of division, examining the basic question of why there is variation between humans and why this variation affects our social behavior. We then examine the consequences of diversity. Why does diversity make the necessary elements of society, such as coordination, difficult?In the second part of the course, we will draw primarily on philosophy to ask if diversity is a desirable state for societies and institutions or if societies should rather seek homogeneity.Having considered these questions, in the third part of the course we examine how political institutions manage diversity by employing different strategies, sometimes strategies of division and sometimes strategies of creating unity. Drawing on classic works of political theory and contemporary political science, we will examine institutions, including ethnonationalist and multicultural states, constitutions, and other institutions that are created to successfully manage diversity.Finally, in the fourth part of the course, we will examine the public policy of managing diversity. How do societies choose to manage public spaces, restrict flows of immigration, and create institutions, such as schools, to reconcile a diversity of interests.",,Faculty of Arts & Sciences,,,General Education,Lecture,,FAS Letter Graded,Course open to Undergraduate Students Only,Ethics and Civics,N/A,None

The course will introduce students to a variety of econometric techniques in impact evaluation and a set of reasoning skills intended to help them become both a consumer and producer of applied empirical research. Students will learn to critically analyze evaluation research and to gauge how convincing the research is in identifying a causal impact. They will use these skills to develop an evaluation plan for a topic of their own, with the aim of stimulating ideas for dissertation research. This is a methods class that relies heavily on familiarity with regression analysis and econometrics. Coursework in econometrics is a pre-requisite for the course without exception. The course is intended for doctoral students who are finishing their course work and aims to help them transition into independent research. The aim of this course is to prepare doctoral students for the dissertation phase of their research and thus they will be given priority in enrollment.

The course begins with a review of several key theories and concepts in political economy, focusing on the strategic interactions between politics and economics in health systems. We examine concepts such as ""path dependency"" to help understand why some policies and institutions are difficult to change; how political institutions like the type of regime (i.e. degree of democracy or authoritarianism) structure political participation and influence health reforms; and how variation in ""state capacity"" shapes the ability of countries to implement complex reforms. We show how these theories and concepts can be applied to explain past events and how by taking into account political and economic constraints, they can be used to design more successful programs and health reforms. We review different empirical methods, including quantitative/causal inference and comparative case study methods and use them to test and extend theory. Theories of policy reform are applied to cases such as health sector reform in Brazil, Turkey, Kenya and other countries based on student interests.

Yet, in an increasingly divided world, public health professionals have been confronted with the growing politicization of health policy debates, including ongoing attempts to question or limit the influence of science in government policy making. These challenges have been particularly visible in crisis situations such as the response to the COVID-19 pandemic or the latest hurricanes affecting large numbers of people and communities. The same challenges have affected the design of public health programs towards vulnerable groups such as migrants, women and children in humanitarian situations across the world. To fulfill their role in these politicized environments, public health professionals must develop capabilities to lead constructive dialogues with a wide range of stakeholders while searching for realistic compromises on policy options. Such capabilities involve the ability of building trust in a tense public arena and mitigating adversarial relationships with actors opposed to the proposed policies. Engaging successfully with these counterparts is becoming a critical skill in current and future public health crises.Through an experiential learning approach, the course will present systematic tools and methods to engage in complex negotiations in a proactive, critical, and practical manner. Based on several years of empirical research on negotiation practices on the frontlines of conflict, health crises and natural disasters, it will equip students with the practical competences and interpersonal skills required to navigate crisis negotiation as well as facilitate learning through the experience of seasoned practitioners working in these environments. Complementing existing courses on public policy and leadership, this course is designed for professionals planning to work in high-intensity environments such as pandemic, climate­-induced crisis, irregular migration, armed conflicts and other critical situations.Course meets over two weekends: March 28-29 and April 25-26, 2026Course Location TBD.",,Harvard Chan School,,,Global Health & Population,Lecture,In Person,"HSPH Student Option (Audit, Ordinal, Pass/Fail)",HSPH: Degree Students,,,

In parallel, three Supreme Court rulings forced the Government to propose to the Congress urgent legal adjustments to the private insurance regulation, while making new efforts to design and approve a broader health sector reform. Second, Chile has been an innovator of health sector reforms and has been a model for several countries around the world. We will have interviews with many participants in the health system, including current and past Ministers of Health, legislators, members of professional associations, health providers in the public and private sectors, academic observers and researchers to get their views on the protests, COVID-19 situation and the broader options for health reform. We will also observe Chile's initiatives in primary care including an important public private partnership and the development of a family medicine approach to community health care.During the course, we will interview key factors in the health system and arrange visits to clinics and hospitals to learn about:the origins of the protest movements and their continuing effectsthe current political issues of the Constitution and the Boric administrationthe course of the Covid-19 pandemic, its reflection of on-going inequalities, and the different strategies to control the pandemictheir innovative health insurance system which involves both public and private insurancetheir experiment in public private partnerships for delivery of primary care (the Ancora Clinics, written up as a Harvard Business School teaching case)the challenges of implementing a family medicine approach in primary care clinicshow municipal governments manage the decentralized primary care systems in urban and rural settings.the challenges of both public and private hospitals in Santiagolegislative initiatives on health form in the Congress in ValparaisoDuring the three weeks, students will be accompanied by Residents in Family Medicine from the Catholic University and they will have a chance to do independent or collaborative research or a practicum on topics of their own interest or in collaboration with the Chilean residents in Family Medicine.Spanish is not a requirement since most presentations will be in English or informal translations available by Spanish speaking students and Chilean residents.**Applications for this travel course are due September 29, 2025.

Politicians talk past each other, national policymaking is increasingly calcified, and states pursue wildly diverging policies that frequently contradict, or even directly challenge, one another. Traditionally apolitical policies are politicized. People tune in to separate and distinct information streams from which they receive contradictory messages about what constitute the nation’s problems, and how best to fix them. They increasingly don’t like each other and seem unable or unwilling to communicate across partisan or ideological lines. Policy disagreement becomes personal animus. More Americans embrace seemingly outlandish conspiracy theories, while it grows difficult for even attentive citizens to distinguish truth from falsehood. All of this is reflected in everything from our lifestyles and social interactions to our consumer behaviors to our politics and public policy. How did we get here? And, most important, what can we do about it? This course will explore these questions through the lens of political communication. To do so, we will consider political communication from the perspectives of three sets of actors: the public, the media -- including traditional (e.g., TV, newspaper, radio), partisan (e.g., cable TV news and online) and social (e.g., Facebook, Twitter, etc.) media -- and policymakers/politicians. In each case, we will consider why the actors make the choices they make. Specifically, we will assess the strategic incentives of all three groups of actors (citizens, journalists, policymakers) and how those incentives can interact to produce unanticipated, and sometimes undesirable, consequences. As we begin to understand the nature of political communication and the causes of our current political communication breakdown, we will consider its effects on various aspects of American democracy, from social justice issues, to voting and elections, to public policymaking. Finally, we will explore various possible solutions to some of the most vexing communication-related challenges we face, from eroding trust in democratic institutions, to hyper-polarization to misinformation and conspiracy beliefs.",Also offered by HKS as DPI 608.,Faculty of Arts & Sciences,,,Government,Lecture,,FAS Letter Graded,,N/A,N/A,Social Sciences

Such songs, known to classicists as ""epinician poems"" or ""victory odes,"" were usually performed in the victorious athlete’s native city. The poet Pindar, whose career coincides with the first half of the fifth century BCE, was a “star” composer of such victory odes, and it was a matter of stratospheric prestige for the family of a victorious athlete to succeed in commissioning Pindar to compose for their native son such a celebratory song. The odes to be read in the original Greek for this course will include selections that all students will be reading, balanced with further selections chosen by each student. The amount of reading will be variable, adjusted to each student’s degree of preparation. For example, those who have already studied Homeric poetry will be able to read more, but those students without such background can catch up rapidly, with the professor’s one-on-one help. To be studied in the course is not only the poetic language of Pindar but also the historical background of athletic festivals and of elitist as well as non-elitist ideologies linking the heroic past as a model for athletes—including women athletes.A book that will be consulted in analyzing the historical background of female as well as male athleticism is the professor’s recent book Ancient Greek Heroes, Athletes, Poetry (2024). Pindar’s poetry, especially with reference to the hero Herakles, figures most prominently in that book.

Nearly fifty percent of these emissions are attributed directly to building construction. And these numbers are predicted to grow, more than doubling the gross amount of material extraction and flow around the planet by 2060. This course asks how we design new architectures that fit within the circuits, circles, and loops of a healthy, regenerative material ecology.Through in-class lectures, case studies, and hands-on workshops, students will develop a comprehensive understanding of both contemporary theory and practical applications surrounding lifecycle material design. They will actively research topics such as systems ecology, extractive geographies, life cycle material modeling, circular design, pervasive connectivity, biomaterials, adaptive reuse, indigenous and traditional craftsmanship, healthy materials, social equity, and other pertinent subjects. Additionally, students will acquire advanced proficiency in utilizing software tools and innovate new fabrication processes to address material flows around and through buildings effectively.Beyond theoretical knowledge, this course offers a unique opportunity for students to actively confront the environmental and human impacts associated with material management in the built environment. Through hands-on, design-led learning experiences, students will be encouraged to tackle these challenges by designing and building real-world prototypes through semester-long team projects that utilize industry and Harvard University material resources. Ultimately, students will develop a robust research framework to investigate, deconstruct, and invent new material life cycle design strategies that critically engage pluralistic design solutions toward a new regenerative architecture.",,Faculty of Arts & Sciences,,,History of Art & Architecture,Seminar,,FAS Letter Graded,,N/A,N/A,Arts and Humanities

This year’s seminar will look at the role of land and the cosmos to art.Land is intrinsic to the art of New Mexico, and perhaps nowhere else is this relationship of red earth, night sky and art as potent or as palpable. New Mexico is home to a millennia deep tradition of art and architecture drawn from the land. From the great houses and cliff dwellings of the ancestral Puebloans to the pulsing landscapes of Georgia O’Keeffe (1887-1986), from the hazy color fields of Agnes Martin (1912-2004) to Maria, the “Chevy El Camino-ization” of black-on-black earthen pottery by Rose B. Simpson (b. 1983), the earth and sky of New Mexico inform and determine the shape of art. Additional subjects and themes will be Pueblo art, Diné art, women artists in the Southwest, pilgrimage and miracles in Spanish colonial art, contemporary art and its market in Santa Fe, and the relationship of art and anthropology.

Our protagonists—Donatello, Michelangelo, Bernini and the Palermitan artist Giacomo Serpotta—defined and re-defined the medium. They worked in a range of materials—bronze, wood, marble, wax, clay, stucco—and presented different paradigms in doing so. Their work was sometimes controversial, peers, critics and successive generations having to reckon with their sculptural propositions. The harmonies and disjunctures of theory and practice will be explored through direct encounters with works of art and materials in the Harvard Art Museums and through the reading of treatises and biographies from the Quattrocento through the Settecento. Over the course of the semester, we will discuss the major discourses and aesthetic categories that governed (and attempted to govern) the medium.Among the most ubiquitous and underappreciated materials in early modern Italian sculpture is stucco. Finished statues, ornament, preparatory models—all were made in stucco. Its properties and effects were exploited by sculptors, sometimes to imitate marble and increasingly, in the Seicento, to render the most fantastical visions of flight, works that could only be achieved in this material. Throughout the semester, we will be working with Francesca Bewer, Research Curator for Conservation and Technical Studies at HAM, to sculpt in stucco.HAA 258G is a graduate-level seminar.

Through a series of case studies, the course explores art historical issues for which the folding screen provides a unique perspective, including the relationships between painting and architectural space, poetic practice, and religious ritual.  Functioning simultaneously as furniture and pictorial surface, spatial divide and architectural decor, the folding screen has played an important role in shaping culture and lived experience in the Japanese archipelago for over a millennium.  Transportable and displayable in a variety of ways, the folding screen can surround a space and immediately charge it with meaning. Some of the most historically significant Japanese paintings were executed in this format, and its influence around the world can be seen in everything from the painted panels of James McNeil Whistler to the biombo of colonial Latin America. This graduate lecture surveys the history and development of the Japanese folding screen from the 8th to the 20th centuries. Each week will focus on one case study from the screen painting tradition to highlight a historical theme and methodological problem closely linked to the unique properties of this format.

This studio originates at the scale of the urban site, and begins with a set of design research assignments that ask students to imagine the city from the perspective of a non-human agent. Extrapolating abstract principles from these agents, we will be mobilizing the possibilities of architectural representation to reimagine the city through mapping, diagraming, and collage.The studio culminates in a design proposal for a site in Harvard Square. Students will be given an architectural brief, and will produce projects that address existing site conditions, programmatic space requirements, and projected users of the site. Technical workshops will provide all the necessary skills required for the course, and will allow students to develop aptitude in architectural drawing, mapping, rendering, and simple animation. No existing expertise or technical proficiency is necessary for this course. Students from all backgrounds are welcome; we will be encouraging interdisciplinary thinking throughout the design research process.",,Faculty of Arts & Sciences,,,History of Art & Architecture,Studio,,FAS Letter Graded,,N/A,N/A,Arts and Humanities

We will explore topics in the history of religions germane to Jung's work: madness and mystical experience, the paranormal and UFOs, symbols, the imagination, and the relationship between a scholar and their historical subject. Critical assessments of Jung from feminist philosophy, anthropology, neuroscience, and comparative religions will be featured.Altogether, we will interrogate what counts as knowledge within the history of religions and what might have been lost in the forgetting of Carl Jung.",Interested students should contact Matthew Dillon (mdillon@hds.harvard.edu) for a petition.,Harvard Divinity School,,,Divinity School,Conference Course,In Person,HDS Student Option (LG/SUS/AUD),,,,

In this seminar, we will work collaboratively to uncover the literary and material evidence of the major shrines and festal celebrations that shaped the history of Israelite religion and early Judaism. In the first half of the course, we will examine key texts of the Hebrew Bible that describe cultic spaces and artifacts, including the ark of the covenant, the tabernacle at Sinai, and the enigmatic “chosen place” of Deuteronomy. We will consider the processes by which the Israelite cult was gradually centralized to a small number of temples and priestly families in Israel, and the way in which centralization enhanced the cultic and economic importance of Jerusalem, for Jews, and Mount Gerizim, for Samarians. In the second half of the course, we will trace the creation of a shared calendar of festivals, including celebrations such as Passover and Sabbath, understanding how the structuring of time linked Jews living in diverse locations and provided a sense of connectivity across a growing diaspora.

The evolution, revivals, and reforms in the Buddhist world have occurred in response to socio-political and economic changes. Changes in communication technologies such as print media, television, radio, and the internet have altered the structure of Buddhism as well as its following. For example, instead of followers going to the temple, the temple has entered the individual’s life through cyberspace. One can even imagine attaining nibbāna while lying in bed and scrolling through social media. While all these changes are occurring, have these new groups changed in their approach to gender? Have women become more present in these male-dominated truth-seeking spaces? At the same time, scholars from various social sciences and humanities backgrounds are trying to understand these new transformations through their scientific categorizations and labels. The course will be exploring these aspects in effort of understanding new Buddhist groups emerging in the Buddhist world across the globe.  Aims and Learning Outcomes By the end of this course, students will be able to understand how social, political, and economic changes influence religion, as well as how religion, in turn, shapes society. Within this discussion, we will explore how market forces, the relative weakening of the state, modern education systems, political changes, and the spread of media and technology have affected dharma and the structure of new Buddhist groups.

These dangerous ideologies often masquerade as environmental consciousness.While contemporary discussions frame such rhetoric as a reaction to the growing awareness of climate change, it has deeper historical roots, particularly visible in American religious writings. Lest we forget that religion (and race) were central to the ecofascist manifestos espoused by the perpetrators of several tragic events: the 2019 Christchurch mosque shootings in New Zealand, where a gunman targeted Muslims during Friday prayers at Al Noor Mosque and Linwood Islamic Center; the 2015 mass shooting of Black churchgoers at Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, South Carolina; the 2019 Walmart shooting in El Paso, Texas that targeted the Latinx community; and the 2022 attack at a grocery store in a predominantly Black neighborhood in Buffalo, New York. In the manifestos, the shooters identified as ecofascists whose mission was to protect and preserve white Christian nationalism in the wake of climate disaster.The manifestos accompanying these attacks have brought greater visibility to ecofascism today, compelling us to examine its historical roots and current operations. Is there a longer history of American religious ecofascism? How can we characterize this history, and what insights does it provide into the functioning of ecofascism in contemporary society? How have communities resisted ecofascism?",,Harvard Divinity School,,,Divinity School,Conference Course,In Person,HDS Letter Graded,,,,

The ancient Persian religions, including Zoroastrianism (Mazdayasna) and Manicheanism, had highly developed theological and philosophical worldviews with monotheistic and dualistic theologies. These included cosmologies of Light and Darkness, Good versus Evil, End-Times messianism, and resurrection that have greatly impacted world religious and philosophical traditions, including Greek philosophical schools, Judaism, Christianity, and Islam, among others. In the post-Islamic period, Persia retained a distinctive place in the development of various Islamic philosophies, including among scholars, sages, poets, and philosophers such as al-Farabi, Avicenna (Ibn Sina), Sohrevardi, Attar, Rumi, Hafez, and Mulla Sadra. This has included highly mystical (Sufi/Irfani) understandings of religion that have shaped Islamic thought and culture to the present time, especially in Iran as the main center of Shi'a Islam, heavily impacting the development of Shi'a Islamic thought, philosophy, and identity. This course provides an introductory survey of several Iranian religions and philosophical-mystical traditions from the pre- to post-Islamic periods, ending with Muslim scholars of the 20th century and the Islamic Revolution of 1979 in Iran.

Meanwhile ecosystems are collapsing and global temperatures continue to increase, driving floods, droughts and fires, and threatening to make a significant fraction of the earth’s surface uninhabitable. How did we get here? How can we bear the feelings of grief, rage and powerlessness that opening ourselves up to what is happening often entail? Are we looking at collapse, or could this moment be laying the foundation for opening towards something new?I do not, of course, know the answer to these questions, but this class is for you if you’re looking for a highly interdisciplinary, collective conversation about them, pulling together students from across the university and leading-edge practitioners from a wide variety of fields. My experience has been that you are likely to learn at least as much from the other students in the room as from me.Drawing on a mix of readings, experiential practices and class visits from leading edge practitioners we will explore the idea that a loss of connection – to ourselves, to each other, and to the natural world – is at the root of our current crisis - and that doing the inner work necessary to address this disconnection could not only support us as individuals and communities but might also play a central role in driving broader transformative systemic change. Throughout the class we will explore what all this might mean for you – for the way you experience yourself, for how you frame the meaning and purpose of your life, and for how you decide to engage with the world. My hope is that you will leave the class with a supportive personal practice, a much richer sense for the levers that might drive transformative systemic change and some ideas as to what you might do with your own life. Class StructureIn addition to standard class discussion, most classes will also include some kind of experiential practice and many will include guests: people who are actively trying to integrate operating from a different way of being with concrete action on the ground.Participants will be asked to write a short reflection paper every other week, attend a weekly 90-minute section and participate in a (small) group project which will be presented in the last class.","Admission is by application only, and applications are available from Fed Chavez, (fchavez@hbs.edu).

Tange and his protégés in the Metabolist group dazzled the world with radical proposals for urban communities built either on the sea or elevated in the sky. Shinohara rejected this techno-rationalist stance through the slogan “A house is a work of art” and turned to the single-family house shunned by the Metabolists. The House of White by Shinohara achieves an almost oceanic spaciousness through abstraction and precision. The course will be structured as a series of discursive narratives and debates, such as tradition, transparency, lightness, and technology, which defined architectural practice and criticism in Japan after 1945. Major figures, notably Itō Toyoo, successfully overcame these differences and established new paradigms. We will also position young Japanese architects today, Ishigami, Fujimoto, and Hasegawa, in terms of these historical genealogies and the evolution of a critical discourse.",,Graduate School of Design,,,Architecture,Lecture,In Person,GSD Graded,,,,

This course will envisage this role from a historical perspective. History proves especially useful when dealing with the political dimension of urban infrastructure. From fortifications to smart technologies, infrastructure is inseparable from political intentions and consequences. This political dimension will constitute one of the threads of this lecture course. Other themes of the course will include the relation between cities and their hinterland, the progressive dematerialization of infrastructure, from walls or bridges to the invisible electronic networks that organize contemporary urban life, the rise of environmental concerns and their impact on infrastructural thoughts and practices, the key part played by infrastructure in social and racial inequality, the need to envisage infrastructure differently when dealing with informal settlements. Also of interest will be the changing relationships between cities, nature and infrastructure. More than ever, urban nature appears today as inseparable from infrastructure.'Cities, Infrastructure, and Politics: From Renaissance to Smart Technologies' suggests an alternative way to read cities and their evolution. Historical analysis will systematically serve as a basis to envisage contemporary issues such as the challenges of rising inequality and climate change.

In this seminar, we will work collaboratively to uncover the literary and material evidence of the major shrines and festal celebrations that shaped the history of Israelite religion and early Judaism. In the first half of the course, we will examine key texts of the Hebrew Bible that describe cultic spaces and artifacts, including the ark of the covenant, the tabernacle at Sinai, and the enigmatic “chosen place” of Deuteronomy. We will consider the processes by which the Israelite cult was gradually centralized to a small number of temples and priestly families in Israel, and the way in which centralization enhanced the cultic and economic importance of Jerusalem, for Jews, and Mount Gerizim, for Samarians. In the second half of the course, we will trace the creation of a shared calendar of festivals, including celebrations such as Passover and Sabbath, understanding how the structuring of time linked Jews living in diverse locations and provided a sense of connectivity across a growing diaspora.

This was an age of internationalization in design practices and issues, a process that was accompanied by technological transformation and utopian thinking as well as by rising tensions linked to social inequality, colonial expansionism, and political upheaval. Our work in this course will look at the three pillars of buildings, texts, and contexts in order to find the equilibrium between, on the one hand, localized historical narratives and, on the other, the sampling to which a global purview necessarily gives rise.The transition of architecture to the modern world prompts a series of fundamental questions: How did historical conditions place pressure on the tradition-bound parameters of architecture, on its origins, theories, and pedagogies? How did new conditions of scientific possibility actively reconfigure architecture’s relation to engineering and ideologies of progress? And how, finally, did aesthetic conceptions and approaches, which trace an arc from the demise of the Vitruvian tradition to eclecticism, historicism, and rationalist avant-gardes, intersect with gender, race, society, and politics?This course weaves these questions through topics and themes ranging from technology and utopia to ornament and imperialism. We begin with late Baroque polemics and the disintegration of the Classical system. We consider the multifaceted nature of eighteenth- century architectural expressions in such examples as: the ideal city from royal Jaipur to revolutionary Paris, the split between architects and engineers; origin myths and the status of history; and the formulation of building typologies from churches and factories to slave plantations in colonial contexts. The nineteenth century, which for us is inaugurated by a utopian imaginary, covers key episodes such as utopian socialism in the context of the Industrial Revolution, town planning and racial politics after the Civil War, the Beaux-Arts system in Europe, China, and the Americas, the intertwining of ornament and British imperialism in India, the collision of vernacular traditions and colonial modernity in Africa, and, finally, the global dream of colossal structures and the infrastructural programs of the modern metropolis.",,Graduate School of Design,,,Architecture,Lecture,In Person,GSD Graded,,,,

The rabbit hole, it will be recalled, appears in the opening chapter of Lewis Carroll’s Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, and was itself a passage furnished with bookshelves. There are texts within texts, and worlds within those texts, each and all producing planned and chance encounters between signifiers and signifieds, readers and writers. Questions of page layout, punctuation!, paratexts, narrative structure, paper-making, book-binding and ecocodicology, publishing houses and reading rooms, marginalia and marbled paper, the threaded histories of reading, writing, (though not so much ’rithmetic), illustration, illumination, and blank spaces, the vineyard of text, the mirror in parchment, a scribal world set into print—these and other topics will be addressed with regard to masterworks (major and minor) of literature (Perec, Mallarmé, Sterne, Douglass, Piranesi, Stein, et. al.) and an array of familiar and fantastical books ranging from the sexagesimo-quarto to the Audubonian double elephantine folio.

The course material extends chronologically from pre-history to the present but remains within the cultural heritage of the Western tradition and is, in fact, a course about that intellectual and artistic tradition with examples ranging from Stonehenge and Archaic Greek Kouroi to Breuer’s proposed service to war memorial on Cambridge Common (1945). In-depth case studies will display the variety of monuments and monumentality exemplifying the hermeneutic breadth of these concepts in the Western tradition of art, architecture, and urbanism. The course proposes a fresh look at projects which have been marginalized in academic scholarship and offers viewpoint diversity to other architectural history courses at the GSD.All monuments are about memory but the significance of many, perhaps all, is not stable or fixed but evolves over time. Case studies will highlight how monuments are used in the creation of political and cultural identities. Always awe-inspiring and therefore close to wonder, monuments serve as a powerful idiom which, as historical examples such as Milan’s Castello Sforzesco to Hitler’s Germania show, can be abused. Urban projects will be considered through the lenses of monumentality and memory. Particular attention is given to American architecture and urbanism from the design of Washington D.C. to Rockefeller Center in New York. Some, such as the Seven Wonders of the World, fall into a separate class of monuments, lauded especially for their engineering and technology, while others, such as many UNESCO heritage sites, represent the culture that produced them. We will look to religious buildings and martyria (buildings or shrines over the tombs of martyrs), such as St. Peter’s in Rome, Richardson’s Trinity Church, Boston, and Cathedral of St. John the Divine in Morningside Heights in Manhattan, places of worship, which could be considered an explicit act of memory in a public place. The time seems right for a re-evaluation of the many nineteenth and twentieth-century monuments, monumental buildings, and urban communities done in historicizing styles, which are considered by Modernists as either inauthentic, authoritarian, or both. Throughout the course we will remain mindful of the Modernist rejection of the American examples, asking whether it is true.",,Graduate School of Design,,,Architecture,Lecture,In Person,GSD Graded,,,,

The concept of renewal through “modernization” is increasingly employed by commercial, institutional and government building owners fueling an exponential increase in the volume of rehabilitation activity. Organizations such as the Getty Conservation Institute, ICOMOS, Docomomo and APT have undertaken broader inquiries into addressing the questions that impact the fundamental philosophy of how to work with this large and diverse legacy. This in turn has produced new Heritage Guidelines that are meant to update and complement the existing established international charters to guide appropriate treatment for modern properties.This seminar proposes to identify and evaluate some of the key challenges facing the preservation of modern buildings and sites through a critical analysis of selected case studies exhibiting possible means of addressing these issues while seeking to minimize other perceived programmatic or technical failings. It is hoped that the seminar will foster more detailed investigation of some of the more persistent and complex challenges and how they interface with a general drive to create sensitive design interventions that conserve carbon and increase the sustainability quota of many of these resources.Among numerous topics we will address will be the following:1. Should the evaluative criteria that we develop for modern properties differ from those applied to earlier and/or more traditional forms of construction. Should there be different criteria applied to landmark quality structures versus the Ordinary Everyday Modern (OEM) vernacular?2. Modern structures in many cases use a lot of operational carbon because of thin construction and lack of insulation. How do we devise and vet strategies to enhance energy performance that are appropriately balanced with maintenance of historic character?  3. Design of Interventions: Conservation is increasingly being acknowledged as being an integral, creative part of any renovation and adaptive re-use project, particularly with modern structures, many of which are unloved, leading property owners to increasingly embrace modernization as a strategy to enhance what may be perceived as tired or outdated structures. What is the right balance of new design and conservation, and what is the role of the preservation professional in developing criteria and making judgments as to what constitutes appropriate alteration?The course is open to all GSD students, though knowledge of and interest in the history of 20th century modernism is encouraged. The seminar structure will consist of lectures by the instructor and distinguished guests, student-led discussion of themed readings, and local case study site visits. The final deliverable will be student chosen case studies of an existing building or site that raise critical questions about conservation, interpretation, and the design of interventions. The goal will be to understand how the interventions have used or rejected attributes of the host structure, and the degree to which the result still embodies the design intent and quality of each building campaign.",,Graduate School of Design,,,Architecture,Discussion-based Seminar,In Person,GSD Graded,,,,
The Architect as Producer: Theory as Liberatory Practice,HIS 4497,Ana María León,2026 Spring,Full Term,,,,,,19659,220880,No Consent,,,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,"The past few years have brought the necessity of theory as liberatory practice to the foreground of discussions on architecture. The interconnected crisis of violent war, mass enforced migrations, global warming, precarity, and structural inequality have changed how we understand what architecture is and does. These and other events have highlighted the role of architecture in the rise of wealth accumulation, racism, patriarchy, land dispossession, labor struggle, and environmental disaster. In this course we examine how architects further these processes and how they might contribute to counter them by turning to the role of architecture within the relations of production.The course responds to these challenges—as outlined by bell hooks and Manfredo Tafuri—by thinking about architecture’s position within the relations of production through four interrelated topics: lands, materials, labors, and knowledges. We start by questioning where architecture happens, the land we stand on, the ways in which lands are transformed into real estate, and the role architects play in this process. We then move on to the materials, resources, and objects that architecture is made of, as well as the processes of extraction they are imbricated in. We address the bodies that participate in the making and maintenance of architecture, from building labor to the role of the architect as worker. We conclude by reflecting on the motivations that animate the discipline and its teaching, and the ways in which it is being unlearned and reimagined.Students will be evaluated on class participation, discussion facilitation, short writing assignments, and a research project.

Inscriptions: Experimental Architecture in Contemporary China,HIS 4533,K. Hays,2026 Spring,Full Term,,,,,,19581,226910,No Consent,,,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,"“Let us consider architectural thinking. By that I don’t mean to conceive architecture as a technique separate from thought and therefore possibly suitable to represent it in space, to constitute almost an embodiment of thinking, but rather to raise the question of architecture as a possibility of thought, which cannot be reduced to the status of a representation of thought.”       -Jacque Derrida, “Architecture Where the Desire May Live”A longstanding tradition in Chinese art emphasizes the interconnectedness of calligraphy and painting, which share a common techne for presentation in their use of ink, brush, and paper, and an association with the gongshi or scholar's rock, which often served the literati as the focus of meditation and a source of inspiration. This advanced history and theory seminar will explore several openings for what might be called a contemporary synthetic poetics, which not only organizes and propels the imbricated machinery of these different arts of inscription, but also enables it to set into its structured field the system of architecture; or to be more precise, an architecture of inscription.The hypothesis of this course is that certain contemporary architectural and art practices in China— many in the Jiangnan region, the original site of literati practices , with its focus on perceptions of nature and materiality — reinscribe and map this tradition of inscription in contemporary work. What is more, we will show that it is poststructuralist thought (begun but never developed in architecture theory), that provides the most articulated access to the machinery of architecture’s inscription.Example: In his theoretical writings, the Ming painter-philosopher Shitao articulated the use of the ""single stroke"" of the brush (yi hua) as the generative ""primordial line"" —the conceptual and material support and expressive pulse of all his painting. Three hundred years later, the French psychoanalytic theorist Jacque Lacan returned to Shitao's mark which he translated to French as the trait unaire, his reinscription of yi hua. For Lacan, the unpartitioned oneness of the originary stroke was the ""primordial symbolic term,"" the formalized trace-trait of which is the first step for entry into identification and language. Contemporary architects and artists are engaging the minimal formal structure of generative material marks to explore the related issues of site, place, and memory.This course will expand out from close symptomatic readings of these practices into the context of the poststructuralist theory that intersected with architectural practice in Europe, the Americas, and China. A renewed interest in architecture theory accompanied the new practices and was developed in architecture journals. We will follow that development with close examinations of architectural projects and theoretical texts.Intense reading, lectures, discussions; reading responses, and several short projects are required.",,Graduate School of Design,,,Architecture,Lecture,In Person,GSD Graded,,,,

By juxtaposing human and environmental archives, students will critically analyze how ancient societies perceived, interacted with, and were shaped by their environments. The course engages with ongoing scholarly debates about the potential for ancient modes of resource management, agricultural practice, and ecological adaptation to inform resilient solutions to today’s environmental crises. It further interrogates the methodological and interpretive challenges of translating ancient practice into modern application, asking what is at stake in forging environmental bridges between past and present.

The developmentalist policies of the post war and the totalitarian governments of the 1960s and 1970s led to political turmoil, rural migration, and uneven investment. In this seminar, we discuss the main cultural, economic, and political discourses that shaped the modernity of the Americas and the responses or reactions they prompted in urban and architectural design. By comparing these responses as a series of case studies, the course assembles a modern history of North, Central, and South American cities, public spaces, and buildings as a network of shared and reciprocal influences.We begin by comparing the Law of Indies with the Jefferson grid and tracing the influence of French urbanism in the National Mall in Washington DC and the Avenida 9 de Julio in Buenos Aires. The grand scale of these axes, their iconic obelisks, and relationship to state monuments speaks to the politics embedded in these projects. We shift focus to the aerial view as trope for the distant gaze of the visitor—or the modern architect— and confront the technological determinism of planning with the contingencies of urban growth. We follow the diverging reception of Brutalism in São Paulo, Rio, Chicago, and Boston. The role of public space as protest site brings together Mexico City’s Plaza of Three Cultures and Washington D.C.’s Resurrection City. We problematize technology exchanges in housing solutions by examining Soviet panels in Cuba and Chile, and the PREVI Housing project in Perú. The utopian communities of Open City in Valparaíso, Túpac Amaru in Jujuy, and Drop City in Colorado provide insights into the role of architecture in alternative lifestyles. Finally, we discuss fences and borders by comparing the proliferation of gated communities in South America, the many divisions between San Diego and Tijuana, and real and implied borders within US cities.Themes to be discussed include the relationship between cities and oil dependency, developmentalism and governmentality, participation and pedagogy. Readings include primary sources such as Law of Indies extracts, Le Corbusier’s descriptions of South American cities, and Paulo Freire’s writings, as well as recent scholarship by Greg Grandin and Fernando Luiz Lara, among others.

The revolutionary years of 1911, 1949, and 1978 will serve as our three fulcra, as we investigate how China has tussled with a variety of ‘isms’ (such as republicanism, militarism, nationalism, socialism, and state capitalism) in its pursuit of an appropriate system of governance and social organization. In so doing, we shall also explore the social, economic, cultural, and scientific changes wrought by these varied attempts at state-building.","No prior college level History is required or assumed.

Exam Type: No Exam Many students come to Harvard Law School to learn to correct injustices they have experienced or observed.  Lawyering promises to be a concrete method of social justice problem solving, a set of tools that the lawyer can use to make a positive difference.  But what does it really look like to ""lawyer for justice""?  The strategies and tactics of public interest lawyers vary widely depending on their clients, their causes, their geography, and their own interests, talents, and expertise.  How do you choose how to lawyer?  What tools in the lawyer's toolkit are best suited to your task?  And what are the limits on the lawyer's role?  How do lawyers situate themselves in the ecosystem of change agents, offering their unique skills (and credentials) while making space to learn and benefit from other voices and methodologies? This course will help first-year students explore these foundational questions through interactive sessions led by experienced practitioners teaching and lawyering in the HLS clinical programs and their community partners. Each day, a clinical teacher working on a different social justice problem - immigration, predatory lending, human rights, criminal justice, education, housing, building a solidarity economy, and more - will share their thoughts on what it means to lawyer for justice and will lead students through discussions and exercises that offer first-hand experience of a wide range of lawyering dilemmas and approaches.  Collectively, the sessions will cover a diverse set of lawyering techniques, including impact litigation, legislative and policy advocacy, transactional work, community lawyering, media advocacy, system mapping, and the representation of individuals in proceedings in unjust systems.  The course will end in a full-day ""hackathon"" in which students will apply human-centered design principles to the development of strategies and tactics to address one or more contemporary justice problems.

This January Experiential Term course is focused on the law, policy, and practice of technology in the public interest. As digital technologies transform industries, political systems, and the lives of nearly everyone on the planet, a new job has arisen for lawyers: how can we protect the public interest as innovation swirls in all directions? Societies tend to prioritize creativity, change, and growth in the form of new and exciting digital technologies. This change brings with it great opportunities as well as a new slew of challenges in addressing racial inequity, upholding individual privacy, preserving safety and security, and many other important principles. This course offers a chance for 1Ls during their Winter term to explore this continuously evolving field of law with an emphasis on the myriad ways lawyers can shape the way that technologies are developed, constrained, and managed to promote justice, equity, and inclusion in the broad public interest. Note: There may be days throughout the winter term that require attendance beyond the scheduled times.

This paper can be used to satisfy the analytical paper requirement for J.D. students. Prerequisites: None Exam Type: No Exam This course explores various strategies for systemic law and policy reform, focusing on legal systems that impact children, including the education, youth punishment, and family regulation systems, among others. We examine significant reform initiatives and consider how best to advance the interests of young people. The emphasis is on analyzing different approaches to system change, inside and outside of the courtroom, with the goal of informing students’ future advocacy efforts. During approximately half of the class sessions, we bring into the classroom as visiting lecturers leaders and changemakers from the worlds of policy and practice who represent different disciplines, career paths, and approaches to system change. Through these sessions, we learn how child-centered legal systems (e.g., family regulation, education, and youth punishment) inequitably distribute benefits and harms to various groups of children and think critically about different approaches to systemic law and policy reform. During the other weeks of the course, we convene in smaller learning communities, deepening our understanding of the work shared by guest speakers by using a conceptual model as a tool to 1) retrospectively analyze system change efforts and 2) prospectively plan a campaign to achieve system change. Through readings, speakers, and in other ways, we will endeavor as much as possible to bring the voices of young people themselves into our conversations. Throughout the semester, students work on their own system change project or paper, getting an opportunity to apply their learning to an issue that is important to them. The course places an emphasis on peer learning and integrates opportunities for workshopping and feedback on final projects as part of the bi-weekly learning community class sessions.

Analytical Methods for Lawyers,HLS 2006,Kathryn Spier,2026 Spring,Full Term,,,,,,19725,227053,Instructor,,,False,True,True,False,False,False,False,"Prerequisite: None. This course is designed to be fully accessible to those with no prior quantitative training or background in the subjects covered. Exam Type:  In Class Lawyers in almost every area of practice (litigation, corporate, government, public interest) deal routinely with problems that are usefully illuminated by basic business and economic concepts. This course is designed to teach the most important analytical methods to law students, in a manner that will be fully accessible to those with no prior quantitative training or background in the subjects covered. Using text, classroom activities, and written exercises, we will explore how these tools may be used to analyze concrete problems that arise in a wide range of legal practice settings. The course will consist of seven units: 1. Decision Analysis, Games and Information: Lawyers assist their clients in making a wide variety of decisions, ranging from the settlement of lawsuits to the purchase of property. We will explore a standard technique that has been developed to organize thinking about decision-making problems and to solve them. We will also consider strategic interactions between parties and considerations related to imperfect information. 2. Contracting: Lawyers write many contracts, concerning such matters as acquisitions of land or corporations, creation of partnerships and nonprofit entities, settlement of lawsuits, financing arrangements, and government procurement. This unit presents practical principles concerning what issues should be addressed in contracts and how they might best be resolved. 3. Accounting: Lawyers who counsel clients in conducting their affairs or who represent them in litigation must understand the parties' financial circumstances and dealings, which often are represented in financial statements. Basic accounting concepts will be introduced, and the relationship between accounting information and economic reality will be examined. 4. Finance: Legal advice in business transactions, division of assets upon divorce, litigation, and many other matters require knowledge of valuation, assessment of financial risk, and comprehension of the relationships between those who provide financing and those who need it. We will consider basic principles of finance, such as present value, the tradeoff between risk and return, the importance of diversification, and basic methods for valuing financial assets. 5. Microeconomics: Lawyers need to understand their clients' and other parties' economic situations and opportunities as well as the principles that underlie many of the rules of our legal system. This unit presents basic economic concepts-the operation of competitive markets, imperfect competition, and market failures-that are necessary to this understanding. 6. Law and Economics: Legal rules have important effects on clients' interests, which must be appreciated by lawyers who advise them and by judges, regulators, and legislators who formulate legal rules. We will explore these effects using the economic approach to law, with illustrations from torts, contracts, property, law enforcement, and legal procedure. 7. Statistics: Legal matters increasingly involve the use of statistics in business contexts, in the promulgation of government regulations, in the measurement of damages, in attempts to make inferences concerning parties' behavior (such as those regarding discrimination in employment), and in determination of causation (in tort, contract, and other disputes). We will address the basic statistical methods, including regression analysis, as well as issues that commonly arise when statistics are used in the courtroom.",,Harvard Law School,,,Law School,Lecture,,HLS Graded,,,,
Bankruptcy,HLS 2013,Mark Roe,2026 Spring,Full Term,,,,,,19712,227019,Instructor,,,False,True,True,True,False,False,False,"Prerequisite: None Exam Type:  In Class This basic bankruptcy course covers the major facets of bankruptcy and out-of-court corporate restructurings. Bankruptcy and restructuring law and practice influence business financing transactions. Much of the deal-making in a financing transaction is negotiated in anticipation of a possible reorganization in Chapter 11 or of a corporate restructuring in its shadow. I.e., corporate lawyers often negotiate loans for their business clients; regulators, creditors, and employees of shaky companies want to know what will happen if the company fails. For many lawyers, contact with bankruptcy law is anticipatory or in an out-of-court restructuring and not in front of the bankruptcy judge. When feasible, students will read not just bankruptcy court opinions and the Bankruptcy Code, but materials that financing lawyers use day-to-day: a loan agreement, a prospectus, and a complaint in a loan dispute. In addition, to restructuring basics, I expect that we will consider ongoing bankruptcy disputes involving mass torts, government action, and labor contracts. Students will ordinarily participate in a simulated Chapter 11 reorganization.",,Harvard Law School,,,Law School,Lecture,,HLS Graded,,,,

By Permission: No. Add/Drop Deadline: December 5, 2025. LLM Students: International students on F-1 student visas are required to have Curricular Practical Training (CPT) authorization; LL.M. students are not eligible for CPT. The Child Advocacy Clinic is an externship clinic where students are placed for fieldwork in a legal setting in the child advocacy arena.  The course is the companion seminar.  The Clinic and accompanying seminar are designed to educate students about a variety of substantive areas impacting the lives of children, and the different systems that are meant to serve them.  In addition, the course exposes students to a range of system change strategies to encourage critical thinking about the pros and cons of different approaches. The Clinic is relevant not only for students with a particular interest in children's issues, but also for those more generally interested in system change. Enrollment Options: The Child Advocacy Clinic offers three different clinical fieldwork options: a fall-only clinic, a spring-only clinic, and a winter-spring clinic.  The clinical seminar is taken concurrently with the fieldwork.  All clinic students participate in both the classroom seminar and a clinical fieldwork component during the spring semester. During the seminar, students bring into the classroom their varied fieldwork experiences, presenting on both specific projects and cases in which they are engaged, and also their placement organization's larger vision for improving conditions for children involved in the child welfare, education, and juvenile legal systems. Students reflect on each other's experiences, consider which strategies in the field are working and why, and evaluate the benefits and limitations of different approaches. Students will learn about and thoughtfully consider the unique legal issues affecting young people through reflections, readings and class discussions. Once enrolled in the Clinic, the Clinic director will provide students with a list of fieldwork placement organizations and their potential projects. Students will give the Clinic director information about their background and interests and rank their placement preferences. The director will then match students with a placement based on their preferences, the organizations' needs, and the goal to provide students with a broad spectrum of experiences. Please note that the matching process takes place during the fall; enrolled students will need to be available to communicate with the Clinic director and their host organization about various details.   This course is part of the Youth Advocacy & Policy Lab (Y-Lab).

Substantial attention is paid to the efforts of philosophers, economists, and social theorists to justify, reform, or abolish the copyright system. The course is unusual in several respects.  First, the classes are different from those in most law-school courses.  Each week, one class takes the form of a recorded lecture.  In-person classes are held on Mondays and Tuesdays.  Most consist of discussions of case studies, which are designed to explore in more depth and detail the rules and theories introduced in the week’s recorded lecture.  On occasion, the course also meets on Wednesdays (during the regular class meeting time) to hear guest speakers. Next, the course lacks a traditional casebook.  Instead, all of the reading materials are available online (https://ipxcourses.org/harvard-law-school-copyright-law-2023/) and in a paper compendium that can be purchased through Amazon.  Finally, the Harvard Law School course on Copyright will be paralleled by – and at times will overlap with – a networked course known as CopyrightX.  A detailed description of CopyrightX is available at https://ipxcourses.org/course-overview/.  In brief, approximately 500 students from approximately 70 countries will be watching the same recorded lectures that you watch and will be reading a subset of the materials that you read.  Those students will be organized into “sections,” each led by a Harvard Teaching Fellow.  In addition, roughly 600 students will participate in affiliated courses in other universities, law firms, and nonprofit organizations, most of them in other countries.  You will have an opportunity (not an obligation) to interact with these other groups of students in two contexts:  they will join the class via an interactive webcast on the Wednesdays when guest speakers visit Harvard; and you can participate along with them in an online discussion forum.",,Harvard Law School,,,Law School,Lecture,,HLS Graded,,,,

Designing Dispute Systems for Justice,HLS 2059,Morgan Franklin,2026 Spring,Full Term,,,,,,19878,227383,Instructor,,,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,"Prerequisites: None Exam Type: No Exam This seminar is designed to help students learn and interrogate the theory and practice of dispute systems design (DSD). DSD is the process by which dispute systems designers seek to assist organizations (courts, schools, associations, companies, and communities) to create systems for proactively engaging disputes in an effort to promote feedback, responsiveness, accountability, and organizational effectiveness. At its best, DSD can enable us to surface and engage latent and live disputes, offering constituents of a system a pathway to be heard and to seek redress for unmet needs, while also inviting an organization to identify and address patterns of inequity. At its worst, it can serve to stifle concerns, impeding meaningful accountability while providing cover to the sponsoring organizations, enabling them to avoid making real changes. Over the course of the semester, we’ll seek to understand what makes the difference.   We will explore the foundations and guiding principles of DSD, as well as a variety of case studies and forms of dispute processing, focusing our attention on the questions of whether and how traditional and nontraditional approaches promote justice and whether and how they might be improved. We will look at the role of the designer, the ethics surrounding this work, and consider what practices and principles might help move the field forward.    A limited number of seats in the seminar are reserved for clinical students enrolled in the spring Dispute Systems Design Clinic.

This paper can be used to satisfy the analytical paper requirement for J.D. students. Prerequisite: None Exam Type: No Exam This course offers an in-depth examination of the phenomenon of gender-motivated violence. Following a consideration of the prevalence and variation of types of sexual violence and coercion around the world, we consider questions such as: How, if at all, is violence against women different from other types of violence? How effective have legal strategies to address violence against women been, and what shifts in thinking about gender-motivated violence would be necessary finally to eradicate it? How has the #MeToo movement reshaped the possibility of legal reform? How does the toleration of sexual violence shape people's expectations and sense of entitlements? What are the implications of gender-based violence for the constitutional guarantee of equal protection of the laws? Does equal protection itself have a gendered meaning and reality? Among the types of violence against women we will consider are: intimate-partner violence; domestic homicide; prostitution; rape; sex trafficking of women and children; and violence against women facilitated by the Internet. The readings consist of primary and secondary materials drawn from several disciplines: law, social science, political science, public health, psychology, evolutionary biology and women and gender studies.",,Harvard Law School,,,Law School,Lecture,,HLS Graded,,,,

The skeptical picture of law shows law to be riven by incoherence and conflict and controlled by political choice. Our question throughout: is this picture correct?

A judge, a lawyer, a citizen, a law student cannot answer any legal question without a sufficiently clear sense of what law is— as distinct, say, from religion, or hard science or social science— and what it is that constitutes legal reasoning and argument (as opposed to, say, reasoning in empirical science or theology or mathematics or logic). What sources may a judge consult to resolve a legal dispute, and on what sources should a lawyer rely in making an argument on behalf of a client? Only such commonplace sources as case precedents, statutes, constitutional provisions, administrative regulations, executive orders? May she also consult the bible, or works by moral, political, and legal philosophers? Why or why not? These and related questions are the subject matter of Jurisprudence and of this course. In our exploration of these themes, we will consider competing explanations of the concept of law (among legal positivists, legal realists, natural law theorists, critical legal studies theorists), the role of social and political contest in lawmaking and law application (including approaches to this issue that focus on race, class, and gender in their explanations of law and legal institutions), the nature, extent and limits of reason and rationality in legal argument, the role of virtue in judging and lawyering, and the values that do or should guide legal factfinding. No special background is required. Work for the course consists of class participation and a take-home exam. Cross-registrants are welcome.

It starts with the trial of Nazi leaders at the International Military Tribunal in Nuremberg - with a particular focus on 'genocide' (protection of groups) and 'crimes against humanity' (protection of individuals) - and moves on to explore the impact in the 1990's, when the international criminal law project was ""re-born"" with the creation of the ad-hoc international criminal tribunals, the International Criminal Court, and proceedings against former Chilean head of state Augusto Pinochet in London . The course examines how law is created, interpreted and represented, and shapes our understanding of events over time and among different communities, and through different disciplines and mediums. Using Professor Sands' books East West Street (2016) and 38 Londres Street (2025) as core texts, we will consider the role of individuals and how the Nuremberg precedent has been represented in law, history, literature, and film over the decades; how it has come to have different meanings at different times and in different places in the world; and how it has shaped subsequent developments, from the Yugoslav and Rwanda Tribunals, to the International Criminal Court, and proceedings in domestic courts, such as Pinochet. The course will thus be a study of law itself, how it operates in the world, and of the origins of international criminal law.

A significant set of the norms governing the legal profession apply primarily to plaintiff’s attorneys – rules about advertising, solicitation, investing money in another’s lawsuit (champerty) and contingent fees, for example – while general rules about conflicts of interest and confidentiality have special application when a lawyer represents a plaintiff, or multiple plaintiffs, a class of plaintiffs in a class action, or even a group of cases in a multidistrict litigation (MDLs). These issues are of special interest to students considering a career as a plaintiff’s lawyer (at a firm or public interest group). But they also are important for students more likely to work at defense-oriented firms, as comprehending the incentives of plaintiff’s lawyers, and how the rules of professional conduct structure their behavior, are important components in providing adequate representation to a corporation or other defendant. The course will examine the rules governing a plaintiff’s practice sequentially, from the hunt for clients through judgment or settlement, and then will encompass case studies of a variety of plaintiff’s firms, including local tort firms, national and mass tort firms, class action firms, and litigation funders.

The course will focus on the rapidly-changing legal system that is designed to regulate government ethics. The course will allow students to explore the legal and associated challenges for lawyers who represent clients in ethics-related matters, as well as for lawyers in the government who are charged with applying these complex and onerous rules to federal employees. Over the past few years, numerous ethics-related scandals have led to a substantial overhaul of federal ethics law for all three branches of government. At the same time, growing media scrutiny has made the reputational consequences to individuals and companies caught up in ethics scandals exceptionally severe, even in cases where no legal violation is ultimately established. Providing effective counsel to public sector and private sector clients thus increasingly requires an appreciation of both the legal and non-legal dimensions of ethics-related representations. The course will concentrate primarily on the ethics rules that apply to individuals appointed to or serving in Executive Branch positions, although comparisons with rules in the other Branches will be addressed. The course will follow the timeline for appointees from initial selection to Senate confirmation. The class will emphasize in particular case studies to illustrate the challenges of government ethics regulation. We will also analyze some of the legal and practical questions that lawyers must address at each stage of government service, from initial appointment to departure from office, and the ethics issues that arise for appointees upon their return to the private sector. The course will involve readings from a wide range of sources; analysis of statutes, regulations and case law; and discussion of various approaches to the regulation of ethical behavior by government officials. Students will be expected to become familiar with the principal rules and authorities and with the basic tools used to regulate ethical behavior of government officials and with the role of the lawyer - both in the government and in the private sector - in the representation of parties involved in the system of government ethics.

This seminar examines the changing nature of the legal profession. We do so through direct engagement with cutting-edge, empirical research—presented by leading academics and practitioners—on issues critical to the legal profession. The seminar is structured around three themes—careers and diversity (e.g., the career paths of HLS graduates; the role of student debt), how globalization is reshaping the market for legal services around the world (e.g., global pro bono; the rise of “international” JD students), and innovation and the role of technology (e.g., litigation finance; online courts). Students can view previous weekly topics and guests on the HLS Syllabus archive page. Structured akin to a reading group, each session features an original piece of research presented by the author and a robust class discussion. The authors come from a broad range of disciplines (e.g., law, sociology, political science) and have diverse methodological commitments (e.g., surveys, experiments, interviews). The seminar has a particular focus on assessing the strengths and weaknesses of empirical research, but it is not important for students to have any particular background in empirical methodology. Rather, the goal is to help students become better consumers of the kind of explicit and implicit factual claims that are often made about lawyers and their careers. 1Ls, 2Ls, 3Ls, and LLMs are all welcome.

Prerequisite: None Exam Type: No Exam Title IX guarantees students the right to equal access to educational opportunities. In this course, we consider Title IX from legal policy, jurisprudential and social justice perspectives. We consider the role of various social and political forces on Title IX's interpretation and enforcement, and how it has become the site of contested notions of students' rights regarding sexual assault on campus. Students can expect to learn about litigation strategies, effective advocacy campaigns and the art of law in action. The course analyzes schools' obligation to prevent, respond to, and resolve cases of sexual misconduct. We consider questions including: how do we create cultures of sexual respect on campus? What role can schools play to address most effectively the persistent problem of underreporting? How should schools design their resolution systems to provide justice and fair process for all parties? These questions will be considered against the backdrop of a changing regulatory scheme that can complicate questions of compliance.",,Harvard Law School,,,Law School,Lecture,,HLS Graded,,,,

LLM students must seek faculty permission. Exam Type: No Exam This seminar will present an overview of topics in food law and policy, and will examine how these laws shape what we eat. In the past few years, increasing attention has been paid to a range of issues impacting the food system from farm to fork to landfill. Recent major news stories have covered the U.S. farm bill, climate-friendly farming practices, soda taxes, ultraprocessed foods and food additives, efforts to regulate school meals, and the misleading terrain of expiration date labels. In order to better understand these issues and some of their root causes, we will examine food policy via the lenses of producers, consumers, and corporations, as well as using diverse disciplinary perspectives. Each class will begin with ensuring a shared understanding of the relevant sources of law before delving into policy considerations and discussions of what the law could and should be. We will concentrate on food law in the United States, but will also include comparative global perspectives when helpful. We begin the course by looking at the basic regulation of food, focusing on the history and current issues in rules regarding food safety. We then analyze federal agricultural policy and farm subsidies, and the environmental, health, and safety implications of our agricultural system. The course will cover issues in food labeling, including nutrition facts, health claims, and GMO labeling. Students will also examine the role the government plays in determining what foods are consumed, through its Dietary Guidelines, food assistance programs, and other attempts to increase healthy food access or consumption. Finally, we will evaluate a range of existing and potential policy interventions at the federal, state, and local levels. The reading materials will be provided in a course reader and on the course website, and include various book chapters, cases, regulations, news reports, and scholarly articles that present diverse viewpoints on the topics presented. The seminar is intended to spark debate between different sides of these often controversial issues. The seminar is open to any student interested in food and agricultural policy and its implications on health and the environment, and no background or prerequisites are required. Rather than an examination, students will be required to submit short discussion posts via the online course discussion board; prepare for and participate in an in-class role play debate; and write a policy paper that explains a food law problem and recommends a policy change intended to improve the health, nutrition, or environmental outcomes. Grades will be determined on the basis of these written submissions, in-class role plays, and class participation. Enrollment in the seminar is limited to 22 students and it is open to LLM students by permission. This course satisfies the clinical seminar requirement for the Food Law & Policy Clinic.

For LLM students, Corporations or its equivalent is a prerequisite. Exam Type: No Exam     Overview: This advanced negotiation course examines complex corporate deals. Many of the class sessions will be structured around actual corporate deals, selected for the complex issues of law and business that they raise. Students will research and analyze these transactions in order to present their most important aspects and lessons to the class. The goal is to help students develop their transactional instincts, better prepare them to anticipate deal challenges, and equip them with the skills to creatively address those challenges through contract and deal design. Career Focus: This course is restricted to JD/LLM and MBA students and is geared towards preparing those students to face complex deals of many different natures. In the spring, there are often guest practitioners that join the course, and they hail from both legal and business backgrounds to offer their expertise. The class will be comprised of approximately an equal number of students from HBS and HLS. For HLS students, the basic course in Corporations, Corporations taken concurrently, or permission of the instructor is a prerequisite. A familiarity with basic business concepts will be assumed throughout the course. For HBS students, in addition to the first-year curriculum, a basic Negotiations course is recommended though not required. Educational Objectives:  Topics developed throughout the course include: how negotiators create and claim value through the setup, design, and tactical implementation of agreements; complexities that can arise through agency, asymmetric information, moral hazard, and adverse selection; structural, psychological, and interpersonal barriers that can hinder agreement; and the particular challenges inherent in the roles of advisors as negotiators. The course will also explore the differences between deal-making and dispute resolution; single-issue and multiple-issue negotiations; and between two parties and multiple parties. Course Content and Organization: In previous iterations, this course has been split into four modules. Module 1 introduces the different perspectives that law and business training bring to transactions. Module 2 provides certain building blocks for transactional practice, through a series of focused caselets. Module 3 examines the particular tactical aspects of deal execution and deal drafting. This module will feature two complex negotiation exercises, each focusing on different aspects of dealmaking. Module 4 examines complex corporate deals, focusing in particular on multi-party deals and the lawyer/business interface. Grading / Course Administration: Evaluation will be on the basis of class participation and a final paper or project. The class will be compromised of approximately an equal number of students from HBS and HLS. This course will meet on HBS's campus and adheres to HBS's academic calendar.

The course considers each stage of the appellate litigation process beginning with a general overview, moving to the various bases for appellate jurisdiction in the federal courts, then discussing standards of review, and concluding with an intense review of the anatomy of an appellate brief. We will also briefly consider U.S. Supreme Court practice. Students considering clerkships, particularly appellate clerkships, generally find this course useful. There are about a half dozen small-to-medium-sized writing assignments, which have two purposes: They introduce students to an aspect of appellate practice, and they demand application of one or more of the course’s doctrinal topics. In addition to these smaller assignments, students are also responsible for writing an appellate brief. For all assignments, students are provided copies of relevant practice rules, statutes, cases, and other items. No outside research is involved. The doctrinal portion of the course and the corresponding small-to-medium-sized writing assignments will be covered during the first two weeks of the January Term. The appellate brief will be completed in the Spring Term. During the Spring Term, each student will have a one-on-one meeting with the teacher to review a draft appellate brief.  The instructor, Brian Wolfman, is a Professor from Practice and Director of the Appellate Courts Immersion Clinic at Georgetown Law. Before that, he was a co-director of Stanford Law Schoolâ€™s Supreme Court Litigation Clinic. Before joining Stanford in 2014, for five years, Mr. Wolfman was co-Director of Georgetown Lawâ€™s Institute of Public Representation, where he directed a student-based clinic that handled a mix of individual civil-rights cases and public-interest â€œimpactâ€  litigation.

Comparative Law: Why Law?

Historically, China is said to have developed one of the world's great civilizations while according law a far less prominent role than in virtually any other. This course will test that assertion by commencing with an examination of classic Chinese thinking about the role of law in a well-ordered society and a consideration of the nature of legal institutions, formal and informal, in pre-20th century China-all in a richly comparative setting. It will then examine the history of Sino-Western interaction through law, intriguing and important both in itself and for the broader inquiry into which it opens concerning the transmission of ideas of law cross culturally. The remainder (and bulk) of the course will use the example of the People's Republic of China - which has, for example, gone from 3,000 to more than 650,000 lawyers in a few decades - to ask what it means to build a legal order. Simply stated, what is central and why, what is universal and what culturally specific and why, and so forth? In addition to examining the principal institutions of the Party-state and the uses to which law is put, the contemporary parts of the course will consider issues of the economy (e.g., corporate governance and trade), human rights, the family and much more. This course, which satisfies the Law School's international legal studies graduation requirement for JDs, is intended to be inviting to individuals both with and without prior study of China.",,Harvard Law School,,,Law School,Lecture,,HLS Graded,,,,

This paper can be used to satisfy the analytical paper requirement for J.D. students. Students who choose to satisfy the analytical paper requirement through this course may not also count the course toward their experiential learning requirement.  Prerequisite: None Exam Type: No Exam This course examines and questions the status of the American democracy in the context of its unique history and contemporary challenges, focusing on its survival in a nation increasingly fractured by division and polarization. In doing so, this course explores provocative themes and questions of citizenship, law, self-governance, accountability, and inclusion in American democracy while grappling with issues of class, race, and gender. It moves beyond limited representations of democratization as the quest for universal suffrage and fair elections to a more fluid, real-time construct of competing interests, negotiated outcomes, stressed and malleable institutions, tumultuous changes, and their legal implications. It further clarifies the democratic process as one subject to ongoing interpretation, challenge, and renewal.

Exam Type: No Exam This seminar provides an overview of the historical law and policy decisions that have shaped the U.S. health care system and are informing current debates about health reform. Incorporating varying perspectives, the seminar discusses federal and state policy options to address current health and public challenges. This seminar begins with an analysis of health systems in other countries. Next, we discuss the key policy decisions that have shaped the current patchwork of public and private insurance coverage options in this country. After providing this international and historical context, we analyze in detail the key elements of the current U.S. health and public health care systems through the lens of its impact on vulnerable populations. We look at the components of the federal approach to reform, including the national health care reform law the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. We also consider several state initiatives that highlight how states are acting as laboratories of innovation to implement sweeping health and public health reforms. Finally, we discuss the current health law and policy climate in this country and explore both the opportunities and challenges for health policy solutions focused on increasing access to care and addressing public health concerns. This seminar is open to students interested in health and public health law and policy; no background or prerequisites are required. The reading materials include various book chapters, cases, news reports, and scholarly articles that present diverse viewpoints on the topics presented. The course employs experiential learning techniques, such as role plays, simulations, and discussion posts to spark debate between different sides of often controversial issues. Over the course of a semester, students gain a wealth of hands-on experience in current and emerging health law and policy issues, produce a written policy paper, and develop a range of problem-solving, policy analysis, research and writing, oral communication, advocacy and leadership skills. This course satisfies the clinical seminar requirement for the Health Law & Policy Clinic.

We will also consider meanings and effects of pernicious inequalities in several sociolegal contexts such as geography, race, and poverty/work/labor. Finally we will examine methodologies for ""mapping"" ways that various legal dynamics drive the genesis, elaboration, reinforcement and maintenance of hierarchies of privilege and disadvantage across individuals, groups, localities, regions and nations and more. As we identify key legal drivers in the production of specific adverse inequalities, we will also explore ways that changes in legal ordering might shift bargaining power, redistribute resources or otherwise ameliorate their negative effects.

Leadership & Management Skills for Lawyers,HLS 2547,David Friedman,2026 Spring,Full Term,,,,,,20924,227734,Instructor,,,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,"Prerequisites: None Exam Type: No Exam This reading group will study ways for lawyers to become outstanding leaders and managers in different organizational settings:  private (corporate and law firm), non-profit and government settings.  We will focus on the practical, policy and ethical dimensions of management in these various settings, with a heavy emphasis on practical understanding and skills.  And we will pay particular attention to how gender and race dynamics relate to management and leadership issues. Attorneys can â€“ and should â€“ develop management and leadership skills from their very first day in practice.  As your legal career advances, in the future you may be entrusted to run a government agency (or an entire government), a law firm, a non-profit organization, a companyâ€™s in-house law department, a court system, or a smaller division of any of these.  We will examine principles, case studies and hypothetical problems with an eye to building awareness and habits that prepare you for management roles.  And until you become a supervisor, understanding how managers and leaders function will better prepare you to be an effective counsel and to understand the people and entities with whom you work and interact.   Some of the specific questions and topics we will examine include:  How do you set goals and measure performance for attorneys when so much of what attorneys do cannot be easily quantified (providing sound judgment and counsel, pursuing justice, preventing disputes, etc.)?   What management and communication styles work most effectively in various settings and circumstances? What decisionmaking approaches can managers and leaders use to facilitate good, sound decisions? How can managers handle situations over which they have limited direct authority and control? How can lawyers excel as leaders? How do various compensation systems affect the management of lawyers and how can compensation be optimally structured? How can managers successfully create change in their organizations? How can junior attorneys develop leadership skills and practices that will prove valuable later on in their careers – and what are those key skills and best practices?  We will be joined by special guests throughout the semester who will share their own stories and experiences of managing and leading in different settings.  Past special guests have included Bill Lee (Wilmer Hale managing partner), Stephanie Lovell (Blue Cross Blue Shield Mass. general counsel and Mass. First Assistant Attorney General), Margaret Marshall (Mass. Supreme Judicial Court Chief Justice and Harvard University general counsel), Regina Pisa (Goodwin LLC managing partner), Keren Rimon (Ropes & Gray counsel and Harvard Management Company SVP), Carol Rose (ACLU Massachusetts Executive Director), Barry White (Foley Hoag managing partner and U.S. Ambassador to Norway), and many other talented leaders.

The goal of this course is to introduce students to the law and practice of federal budgeting in the United States. We will begin with the basic structure of the federal budget process, including the President's budget and Congressional budget procedures.  We will explore the roles of all three branches of federal government in setting budget policy in the United States, covering government shut-downs, debt ceiling crises, impoundment disputes, and ongoing debates over budget reforms and fiscal challenges. We will also examine current debates over deficits and public debt levels. Based on student interest, we may also take up entitlement reform, defense spending, budgeting for infrastructure as well as topics related to state budgeting practices and federal-state relations in budget policy.  The course will meet for the first two weeks of the January Term with several luncheon meetings scheduled at which outside experts on federal budget policy will speak.  Blog postings will be due by the third week of the term. Readings will be from Fiscal Challenges: An Interdisciplinary Approach to Budget Policy (2007) (Howell Jackson, et al., eds.) and additional distributed materials.

Philosophical Analysis of Legal Argument: The Logocratic Method in an Uncertain Time,HLS 2526,Scott Brewer,2026 Spring,Full Term,,,,,,19749,227102,Instructor,,,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,"Analytical Paper Required: All enrolled students complete a research paper of at least 20-25 pages, with faculty and peer review of a substantially complete draft. This paper can be used to satisfy the analytical paper requirement for J.D.     students.Prerequisites: None Exam Type: No Exam Ours is a time fraught with uncertainty about the stability and legitimacy of political and legal institutions and the security of our individual health and that of the planet. To a surprising extent, the human capacity to make, receive, and be convinced by arguments is central to the way we make sense of information about both our individual lives and the world in general. Arguments are also central to the operations of vital domains of life, including politics (think about the political effects of social media), law (think about the contentious issues that come before the Supreme Court as well as who should sit on the Court), and everyday life (think about urgent decisions to be made about public health and personal precaution during a pandemic). This course presents a detailed philosophical examination of arguments and their operation and effects in legal, political, and everyday life. The course framework is the Logocratic Method, a systematic method for understanding the nature of arguments and their principal uses, which can enhance one's ability both to make and to critique arguments. Although the Logocratic Method applies to arguments in any domain, our principal focus will be on legal and political arguments. From a Logocratic point of view, these tools of analysis are to lawyering and political persuasion as materials engineering is to architecture. One must know the strengths and the weaknesses of the materials from which an edifice is built, and, no less importantly, the different ways in which these materials can be strong or weak, lest it collapse under its own weight - whether the edifice is a dome atop a cathedral, an argument for plaintiff, prosecutor, or defendant, or an argument for the electability of a candidate or in favor of or in opposition to a legislative policy. Readings are from philosophers, legal and political theorists, as well as from cases, statutes, and political speeches. Although the course introduces and uses some basic techniques from formal logic (familiar to all LSAT-takers!), this course presupposes no background in logic or philosophy. Work for the course consists of class participation and a paper that applies the methods learned in the course to a case or political speech (to be agreed in consultation with the professor).

There are major debates on incarceration issues swirling in the general public and in the legal community ranging from the morality and efficacy of solitary confinement to the effects of prison overcrowding to the proper administration of parole to the appropriateness of life sentences without parole for a variety of populations and crimes. The effects of incarceration fall disproportionately on communities of color and perpetuate the cycle of poverty. Through a combination of practical experiences and written texts, students will examine the experience and effects of incarceration and parole locally, nationally, and internationally. Experiences in the seminar will include touring local prisons or jails, meetings with lifetime parolees and formerly incarcerated individuals, and a wide variety of written texts, including essays, case studies, and research.

Law in Capitalism,HLS 2630,Yochai Benkler,2026 Spring,Full Term,,,,,,19788,227176,Instructor,,,False,True,True,False,False,False,False,"Prerequisite: None Exam Type: No Exam What is capitalism, what role does law play in shaping market societies, and what role do the dynamics of capitalism play in shaping law? The course will begin by looking at various approaches to defining capitalism and its dynamics, and to thinking about law and the institutional political economy of capitalism. We then follow the changes in property law that drove the emergence of capitalism in England, and the fundamental legal choice points that shaped the trajectory of American capitalism, including the development of racialized enslavement in the American colonies in comparison to other major models of countries that transitioned to capitalism later in the 19th century. We conclude the first section of the course with a study of changes in labor law, corporations, and torts as Big Business emerged in the Northeast and Midwest in the late 19th century, shaping of the uniquely weak status of American labor during the â€œSecond Industrial Divide,â€  and the network of legal elements governing property, contract, credit, trespass, game, and criminal labor law that laid the foundations for racialized class structure in the post-Reconstruction South.  After learning about the rise of Legal Realism in reaction to the judicial imposition of laissez faire at the turn of the 20th century, the heart of the course revolves around the role of law in supporting the emergence of a broad, primarily white middle class from the 1930s to the 1960s, the structuring of racialized class in response to the Great Migration outside of the South, and then, since the 1970s, the dismantling of the welfare state, its displacement by mass incarceration and a punitive welfare regime, and changes in the law governing labor, banking, financial regulation, antitrust, corporate governance, and trade that drove the dramatic increase in precarious employment, the stagnation of middle class wages, and the spectacular escape of the 1%, unique to the United States among advanced market society. We will consider why the same global pressures that drove the transition from mid-century â€œGolden Age of Capitalismâ€  institutions to neoliberal capitalism nonetheless followed different paths among liberal, corporatist, and social democratic market societies, resulting in significant differences in the levels of income inequality, social mobility and social dislocation, as well as productivity growth and innovation. The course concludes with examination of proposed reforms, and assessment of their likely effectiveness on the background of the experience of regimes within American capitalism covered in the first ten weeks of the course.

Exam Type: No Exam The Policy Advocacy Workshop is a hands-on seminar that will explore the methods, tools, and skills used to conduct legislative and regulatory advocacy. Many law students are interested in using their legal education as a pathway to engage in policymaking. This course will provide students with a range of active opportunities to learn about, discuss, and practice written and oral policy advocacy via simulations and assignments. Students will learn about the process of issue spotting policy opportunities, developing policy advocacy campaigns, drafting legislation and regulations, and using written and oral advocacy to push for policy change. Students will learn how to effectuate policy reforms that could have real world application by drafting written materials and presenting oral advocacy to demonstrate an implementation strategy for a range of policy reform ideas. After a few weeks of introductory reading and discussion, there will be short written assignments or preparation for in-class simulations due each week. The students not participating in the assignment for the week will workshop and provide input on the writing and presentations of their classmates, and discuss strategies and skills for improvement. Each week will focus on a different type of skill or written document relevant to policy advocacy. These will include:  Issue spotting and policy development Petitioning agencies and commenting on agency regulations Legislative research and drafting Writing policy briefs Communications and media strategy Grassroots advocacy Creating fact sheets and sign-on letters Testifying for policymakers  Classroom sessions will also include presentations from guest lecturers who have relevant policy experience, including advocacy organizations, think tanks, and policymakers.

Harvard Law School students who satisfy these requirements may enroll by emailing Eve Radovsky (at eradovsky@law.harvard.edu) by December 1. Other students may enroll only with the permission of the instructor. To seek such permission, please send a resume and an explanation of your interest and qualifications to tfisher@law.harvard.edu by November 17. Exam Type: No Exam This course is designed for students who are interested in deepening their knowledge of copyright law and gaining experience with law teaching. Each student in the course will be a Teaching Fellow for CopyrightX, an online copyright course taught by Prof. Fisher to roughly 500 students worldwide. The weekly meetings of the course have two functions: to provide an advanced seminar on copyright; and to provide students guidance and support as they learn to teach. CopyrightX closely parallels the HLS course on Copyright. Like the HLS students, the CopyrightX students learn the essential elements of both doctrine and theory by watching videotaped lectures prepared by Prof. Fisher, reading cases and secondary materials, and watching webcast special events in which guest speakers examine controversial current topics. In addition, each CopyrightX student participates in a 25-person seminar led by a Teaching Fellow. Each Teaching Fellow has two primary responsibilities: to conduct each week an 80-minute live online discussion that uses case studies to refine the student's understanding of the pertinent laws and policies; and to draft or revise (at some point during the semester) one case study that will be employed both by Prof. Fisher and by the other Teaching Fellows to facilitate discussions. In addition, the Teaching Fellows will meet once a week with Prof. Fisher to discuss the issues addressed in the lecture and readings for that week and to exchange ideas concerning possible ways of teaching their own seminars. During most weeks, this meeting will be held during one of the time slots allocated to the regular Copyright course.

How does change happen? When, why, and how do people, and whole nations, come to together to influence large-scale policies and actions on issues like the environment, equality, criminal justice? Why do revolutions occur? This course will try to answer these questions, and do so by exploring a diversity of efforts related to societal change. In an effort to draw general lessons for those interested in making change, we will assess a range of political and legal approaches; examine mass movements and the leadership by organizations, governments, and individuals; and attempt to gauge outcomes. Using research from psychology, political science, and economics, and focusing on case studies, the course will explore the ideas behind several arguments: 1) big problems are rarely resolved with comparably big solutions, but instead are better met with small acts of reform; 2) coalition-building among strange bedfellows is usually indispensable; 3) agents of change fare best when they look to measure their impact and never lose sight of the real world results they seek, rather than the expressive highs along the way; 4) informational â€œcascadesâ€  are possible and critical, as people follow one another; and 5) group polarization can be both desirable and dangerous, as groups become more heated and more extreme.

They will learn about the strategic reasons and tactics for mergers and acquisitions, LBOs, corporate divestiture, restructurings, and hostile takeovers from investment bankers' perspective. Case studies of mergers, acquisitions, and LBOs drawn from a variety of different industries throughout the world will be examined. The class workload and assignments will be challenging, requiring students to apply learned concepts, tools, and techniques to real-world problems. Active participation is required. There is no final exam. Instead, there will be a final take-home project requiring students to build an advanced merger model and a pitchbook (40-50 hours workload) as one would do in an investment bank. Course materials will include textbooks, cases, and modeling video tutorials. No prior experience in finance is required. On contrary, the ideal student is highly motivated with no practical investment banking experience. This course is intended for students who want to embark on a career in finance or who will practice corporate law (mergers and acquisitions, capital markets, corporate transactions, and other related fields).

Latinos constituted more than 50% of all population growth in the U.S. since 2010. Despite rapid population growth, and their new status as the largest racial minority in the U.S., Latinos continue to struggle against racial discrimination and structural barriers in the areas of education, employment and political participation. The need to combat anti-Latino discrimination in a context of fast-changing demographics, both within and outside the U.S. Latino community, poses an urgent challenge for lawyers whose main tools are civil rights statutes and legal precedent that often are more than 50 years old. This reading group will explore present-day legal cases challenging racial discrimination against U.S. Latinos and the success (or lack of success) of that litigation. We will discuss theories and strategies available to challenge discrimination as well as the continued utility of the established framework of civil rights statutes and precedent. Readings will include a range of texts (judicial opinions, scholarly writing, and popular commentary) to explore these topics. Each student will be required to write a brief single ""response paper"" during the semester addressing the assigned readings for a particular class day and setting out some questions for general class discussion.

This paper can be used to satisfy the analytical paper requirement for J.D. students. Prerequisites: Corporations, or the equivalent experience in legal practice with permission of instructor.  Exam Type: No Exam Grading will be based on class participation and a 25 page research paper. Paper topics require the instructorâ€™s approval. Unlike large corporations in most of the world, the control of the modal large U.S. corporation famously rests in the hands of its managers and board of directors rather than in those of a controlling shareholder or a shareholder or a control group.  Recent developments, however, seem to suggest that concentrated ownershipâ€”or at least concentrated voting rights anchored by significant equity share ownershipâ€”have made a comeback in American companies. Some commentators see a resurgence of equity-based control in the shift from retail share ownership to institutional ownership and others note the rise in of private equity. But from the perspective of corporate law, the most salient immediate consequences follow from the rise of large founder-controlled firms in the tech sector.  In this seminar, we explore challenges faced by Delaware corporate law in responding to the demands of the new controllers. This requires a close reading of the Delaware caselaw and statutory amendments as well as the literature on interstate competition to attract corporations.  Later seminar readings will include commentary on the rise of institutional ownership in the U.S. and the role of controlling shareholders in several foreign jurisdictions.",,Harvard Law School,,,Law School,Seminar,,HLS Graded,,,,

In the first part of the course, we seek to identify the salvageable residue in the idea of American exceptionalism, the thesis that the United States is radically different from every other society. We ask what is really special about the United States and what it has in common with other major countries in the period of its independent life. In the second part of the course, we consider the limitations of change, as well as the opportunities for transformation, revealed by the crisis of the 1930s and by what has happened in the U.S. since then. In the third part of the course, we reconsider this past through the lens of the lives and ideas of a few American political, economic, and spiritual leaders. In the fourth part of the course, we discuss the future of the American project and the institutional innovations on which the deepening of American democracy depends.

What role can and should lawyers play in community led, organizer driven campaigns and movements to end mass incarceration? This seminar explores this essential question experientially, intellectually, and personally. Students begin the seminar by taking an intensive multi-day workshop that trains them in the theory and practice of community organizing. In teams facilitated by experienced organizer-coaches, students learn the craft of public narrative, weaving together stories of self and of shared communal purpose to motivate collective agency; the meaning of public leadership within the context of organizing teams; the relationship between strategy and tactical action; and the connection between organizing campaigns and enduring structures of community power. The workshop is team-based and coaches students in linking their personal sources of inspiration and motivation to focused and purposive action that is in service of social justice and emancipation. The remainder of the semester focuses on lawyering and its relationship to organizing, movements, and social change. Can law be a useful tool in efforts to upend entrenched injustice, including systemic racism and economic oppression? How can lawyers share skills, knowledge and resources while supporting the collective agency and empowerment of nonlawyers working for bold emancipatory futures? What forms of relationships between lawyers and organizers in shared coalition spaces best facilitate such partnerships? And what do legal tactics that aim to support enduring community power, even above short-term campaign victories, look like in practice? Students can expect to engage closely with readings from various traditions, including from scholars of abolition, critical studies (CLS and CRT), and law and social movements.

Exam Type: No Exam With the law of abortion in flux, it is important for future lawyers to have an opportunity to study the issue in detail and to decide what they think. This seminar is intended to give students a chance to discuss, in a relaxed academic setting, the difficult and important questions of ethics, policy, and law raised by abortion. These include questions of human personhood and futures of value; of autonomy and sex equality; of politics and history; of unenumerated rights and stare decisis; and of federal and state regulation. Many of these questions are both highly abstract and deeply personal. While they are the subject of intense and heartfelt commitment on both sides, this course is offered in the belief that they are also a proper subject for intellectual inquiry. Within each unit, the assigned readings are roughly balanced as to viewpoint; they take deeply conflicting positions, and you will certainly disagree with some of them. Students will write occasional short papers in response to the readings, and each student is expected to participate fully in the discussions.

Students will study SEC filings related to these transactions in order to discover the strategies behind their particular form and structure. The course will be presented from the vantage point of legal and financial advisors to the transaction, so that students will become familiar with the framework that governs these corporate transactions, with a particular focus on â€œreal worldâ€  approaches and strategiesâ€”how abstract principles are applied in practice and how ambiguities and uncertainties are resolved (or managed). In addition to assuming the role of â€œadvisors,â€  students will explore the role of public filings as the â€œcase lawâ€  of public deals and their practical precedential effect, the gatekeeping function of investment bankers and lawyers in a system of voluntary enforcement, the legislative and regulatory responses to publicly announced deals, and the intended and unintended consequences on deal dynamics. The goal of the course is for students to gain a general understanding of the relevant legal and financial concepts, as well as how these concepts create their own body of tax and corporate â€œloreâ€  (if not â€œlawâ€ ) and their normative implications. The course will take a â€œcase studyâ€  approach, by focusing on particular transactions and categories of transactions to explore how themes develop. Relevant tax concepts or statutory provisions will be discussed as relevant to each class, but the focus will be on understanding how such concepts affect structuring of the transaction and the evolution and development of such concepts across multiple transactions. Themes and transactions studied will include, illustratively,  Spinoffs I: Yahooâ€™s attempted spin-off of its stake in Alibaba (tax-free spin-off rules including device, business purpose and the active-trade-or-business requirement; cross-border taxation); Trip Advisor & Trip Advisor Holdings Spinoffs II: Disneyâ€™s acquisition of major assets from 21st Century Fox (taxable spin-off; spin-merge transactions; basis step-up) UP-Câ€™s: Blackstone IPO and its reincorporation as a C corporation UP-Câ€™s & Exchangeables: Merger of GEâ€™s oil and gas services business with Baker Hughes (â€™40 Act considerations; use of partnerships in M&A tax receivable agreements) Tracking stock: Liberty Media (use of tracking stock and potential split-off)",,Harvard Law School,,,Law School,Lecture,,HLS Graded,,,,

But this growth obsession is no longer working. The global climate crisis shows how the Earth itself cannot take it. Toxic wastes are mounting, while frenzied extraction is eroding the land and polluting the seas. Mega-cities, devoid of adequate infrastructure, are exanding on every continent. Growth-propelled inequalities are spiraling. Good work is in short supply and low-paid workers are undermined by short-cuts in job safety and speed-up on the production line. In the face of these mounting forces, theorists and activists from many sectors are pushing back against the mantra of growth-at-all-costs through a new “de-growth” consensus. The practical challenges of de-growth are both great and converging. How can political/economic/legal worlds be linked at the local, regional, national, and even global levels, so as to enable communities to thrive? How can extraction and production be orchestrated so as to make what we need and want without flooding us with what we don’t? How can the land be shared, preserved, and used so as to provide food security, living space, well-being, and more? How can just financial institutions be created on the community level? Promising experiments in all these spheres are now under way. At the same time global networks of scholars are creating forward-looking theories to undergird this hands-on work. In this offering we will map the literatures in the emerging de-growth field. We will start by surveying several examples of de-growth experiments in production, housing, food, and community justice. We will then survey key theoretical interventions in the domains of de-growth, post-development, and Buen Vivir through key readings. We will then consider de-growth themes in human rights doctrines and national constitutions. Finally, we will consider strategies of leading de-growth social movements.",,Harvard Law School,,,Law School,Seminar,,HLS Graded,,,,

The Council is often referred to as the world’s executive, but it also increasingly exercises a kind of legislative power. Its discretion is extensive, if not unlimited. Its power is ostensibly justified, as states have conferred to it the primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security. Has the Council lived up to this weighty challenge?  The seminar will engage intensive current debates about possible reform of the Council, foundational questions concerning its current and potential role, its representativeness, its impact, and its relevance. We will explore these questions by examining several contemporary legal and policy issues concerning the Security Council. These include issues related to interpretation of Security Council resolutions, disobedience of the Council’s decisions, the role of Elected Members, and proposals for institutional reform, as well as various thematic and country-specific matters pertaining to, among others, war and peace, climate change, and terrorism (potentially encompassing issues developing in real-time during the semester).",,Harvard Law School,,,Law School,Seminar,,HLS Graded,,,,

The resulting involvement of international lawyers in developing responses to climate change in an unequal world has been a deeply contested project. This course explores the varied roles that international lawyers and international institutions have played in shaping responses to climate change, the competing legal projects and strategies that they have developed to do so, and the shifting geopolitical contexts in which this work is taking place. Our focus will include the role of international lawyers in multilateral negotiations conducted under the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, the move by small island states to seek advisory opinions on climate change from the International Court of Justice and the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea, the turn to human rights litigation as a means of demanding greater climate action from states and the fossil fuel industry, the use of trade and investment agreements as a basis both for promoting and resisting state regulatory responses to climate change, expanding the role of the UN Security Council to address climate-related risks to international peace and security, and the proposed international crime of ecocide. We will explore how the relative strengths of states, corporations, investors, and civil society organizations in different international fora have influenced the direction of new treaties, litigation strategies, security agendas, and multilateral projects. The readings will include texts from law, history, political economy, and social theory, designed to interrogate how broader narratives of climate change are used to justify particular technical legal projects. Throughout, we will evaluate whether and how international lawyers are supporting or delaying the decarbonization of the global economy, and which actors are empowered by different forms of international legal engagement with climate change.

Emerging at the intersection of environment and civil rights, the environmental justice movement is a response to the lived experience of people of color, low in come, and other marginalized communities, and an indictment of the many ways that race, class, language, and national origin determines environmental burdens and affects peopleâ€™s access to environmental decision-making. This course will explore the history of the environmental justice movement in the United States, its connection to the long history of racism, classism, and other forms of discrimination in America, key features of modern environmental justice advocacy, and the laws and policies that both helped to created (and perpetuate) environmental inequity and that seek to remedy environmental injustice. We will explore important principles of procedural justice and distributive justice and how they play out in the environmental arena, the role of federal agencies and federal regulatory programs like the Clean Air Act, and the relationship between the environmental justice community and the mainstream environmental movement.

Do China's guarantees respecting national minority rights meet international standards regarding the right to self-determination or the protection of minorities. Might reference to the rights of indigenous people be helpful? The approach of the seminar will be to interrogate the best ways to address these issues and find solutions. We will look at the evolution and major changes in the stand of the Dalai Lama from seeking independence, to what he has described as a zone of peace for Tibet, and finally to ""genuine autonomy for Tibetan people"" within the framework of the Constitution of the PRC.

To face these and other challenges the IASHR is a forum in which standards of State responsibility to prevent, create accountability and provide reparation are discussed and identified through cases, research and political dialogue; and the outcomes of all these processes can be systematized under thematic categories to serve as inspiration for policy and programmatic action. This reading group will explore the historical foundations, current functioning, and future expectations of the Inter-American machinery, and explore case studies of thematic development, including the human rights of women and girls, LGTBI persons and indigenous communities and peoples, and the inter-American jurisprudence and doctrine in relation to human rights violations such as torture, forceful disappearances and extrajudicial executions. The base for discussion will be provided by scholarly articles, selected Judgements and Reports and international instruments such as Treaties, Declarations and Resolutions. These will create an understanding of the basic functioning of the Inter-American System, with particular emphasis on the achievements of the Inter-American Human Rights Court and Commission, raise some of the critical readings of its limitations, and provide participants with a base for subsequent engagement with the Inter-American machinery.

"Guns, Abortion and Climate Change - What is next for State AGs?",HLS 3206,James Tierney,2026 Spring,Full Term,,,,,,19822,227257,Instructor,,,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,"Prerequisites: None Exam Type: No Exam This Reading Group explores the role of all state attorneys general as they deal with abortion, climate change and gun violence with an emphasis on the expansion of each state's Unfair and Deceptive Practices Act. The Court’s decision in Dobbs. v. Jackson Women's Health Organization forced state attorneys general to reassess their responsibilities regarding reproductive rights. Dobbs has driven state attorneys general to decide how to best address the issue with health providers, local district attorneys and the federal government. The Court’s decision in Loper Bright v. Raimondo and decisions of the Trump Administration has changed the way state government and attorneys general address their continued reliance on federal regulations.  Specific attention will be given to the “Major Question Doctrine.” The impact of Loper Bright and West Va. v EPA extends into core attorney general duties of health, consumer protection and education. The Court’s decision in NYS Rifle and Pistol Assoc. v. Bruen struck down the New York City gun control statute and attorneys general are analyzing the best ways forward in the fight against gun violence.  The class would involve an in depth review of Dobbs, Loper Bright, West Virginia and Bruen as well as discussions of the decisions of the Trump Administration. The class would also involve direct bipartisan virtual participation appearances of attorneys general and their senior staffs. Given the intensity of views on these issues care will be taken to assure balanced presentations and respectful class discussions.

This course examines the origins and substance of the laws governing presidential elections, focusing on the historical circumstances (and crises) that forged much of our current legal framework, as well as the disputes that that legal framework has generated in recent elections. It will also examine ongoing policy debates, including recent changes to the Electoral Count Act and other policy recommendations growing out of the work of the Select Committee to Investigate the January 6 Attack on the U.S. Capitol, as well as longstanding debates about the Electoral College and potential alternatives. Where does the law of presidential elections provide a clear structure, and what questions does it leave unanswered? What substantive values - and what conceptions of the presidency - does it advance? How might we design a more desirable or more durable legal and political framework?

Statutory Interpretation in a Constitutional Democracy,HLS 3214,"John Manning, Stephen Breyer",2026 Spring,Full Term,,,,,,20779,227724,Instructor,,,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,"Prerequisite: Instructor permission is required for enrollment. Applicants should send a resume and statement of interest (with reference to prior coursework and experience related to statutory interpretation) to Emma Reilly at ereilly@law.harvard.edu. Application deadline is December 1, 2025. Exam Type:  No Exam This reading group will consider statutory interpretation in light of the proper roles of the three branches in American constitutional democracy. The group will cast particular focus on questions about the proper role of the federal judiciary in interpreting and applying statutes. Should the federal courts strive to decode the most accurate reading of statutory texts, acting as Congressâ€™s faithful agents in the work they do? Or should federal courts, as principals of a co-equal branch, take responsibility for making statutory programs work sensibly and effectively, acting as Congressâ€™s partners in the enterprise of governance? How, if at all, do our answers change when Congress has given federal agencies primary responsibility for carrying out the programmatic aims of federal statutes? Finally, what metric does one use answer the foregoing question? Do our answers come from the text and structure of the U.S. Constitution, from the accretion of constitutional practice, from a political theory of how best to make a constitutional democracy serve the broad goals of public welfare, or from some other source? This Reading Group will rely on a mix of cases and scholarly articles to explore those issues. Members of the Reading Group will be responsible for reading all of the cases listed for a given week. They will also be asked to read one of the listed articles each week (linked in the syllabus to HeinOnline) and to submit one question on the article they have selected for that week. The question may not exceed 150 words total and should be uploaded to Canvas no later than 5:00 p.m. on the day before that weekâ€™s session.

We begin with Solomonâ€™s judgment and Bractonâ€™s counsel to the sovereign (quoted above), move through Magna Cartaâ€™s promise of peer participation in sovereignty, and follow the juryâ€™s evolving function as the peopleâ€™s voice in law: from the Declarationâ€™s â€œall men created equal,â€  through the Constitutionâ€™s protections of liberty by grand and petit jury, to the struggles over slavery, commerce, race, and civil war that shaped American legal institutions. Along the way we confront the juryâ€™s corruption and contraction â€” nullification, plea bargaining, waivers, death qualification â€” and examine how judicial choices shifted power from the people to the executive. Our discussion will take us through episodes of racial injustice, political repression, and civil rights struggle, culminating in a reflection on the 250th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence. Students will be invited to write papers engaging the central question with which we conclude: Where do we stand, as individuals, in light of our national history? Note: Professor Nesson's prior Jury offerings (Trial by Jury, JuryX Workshop, Justice for Lawyers, and Jury Deliberation in the Age of AI) substantially overlap with this new seminar, so students who have completed any of his prior Jury offerings will not be eligible to enroll in this seminar for credit.",,Harvard Law School,,,Law School,Seminar,,HLS Graded,,,,

There have been fears over the rise of â€œpopulism,â€  the phenomenon of â€œdemocratic backslidingâ€ , and the emergence of new authoritarian regimes. These events present an opportunity to reflect on the relationship between law and authoritarianism. Covering historical episodes, contemporary challenges, and regions ranging from Eastern Europe to Asia to the United States, this seminar will consider the role that law plays in authoritarian regimes and during periods of autocratization.

Money – a legal institution - becomes a mode of nation-building and a dimension of internal governance.  By the same token, states have extended their reach across borders through monetary means, either displacing indigenous systems or extracting payment through financial leverage. But money can also operate as a mode of resistance, subversion, or reparation.  This reading group will explore accounts of empire effectuated through monetary leverage with an eye to monetary resistance as well.  We will draw from scholarship from and about Haiti, parts of Africa, Latin America, early America, Europe, and/or the Middle East.

Oversight and Separation of Powers,HLS 3272,Medha Gargeya,2026 Spring,Full Term,,,,,,19935,227512,Instructor,,,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,"Prerequisite: None Exam Type: No Exam The United States Congress wields investigatory powers to review, monitor, and supervise the executive branchâ€™s implementation of public policy. This â€œoversightâ€  authority takes many formsâ€”committee hearings, investigations, subpoenas, requests for information, and reportsâ€”and has been exercised during several high-profile government controversies from the Teapot Dome Scandal to Watergate to January 6th. Congress's oversight authority is considered essential to Congress's legislative powers under Article I and the separation of powers more broadly. Yet, scholars and government officials alike have observed that the executive branch has developed an expansive view of presidential power and executive privilege; one that stymies congressional requests for information and minimizes Congressâ€™s oversight power as secondary to the executiveâ€™s ability to perform its constitutional responsibilities. Courts, wary of entering the political thicket, are forced to referee the branchesâ€™ competing views on their spheres of authority. This reading group explores oversight as an interstitial ingredient in our system of separation of powers, and specifically examines the normative and positive dimensions of each branchâ€™s role in the oversight process. Students will hear from former congressional staffers and executive branch officials with experience navigating oversight disputes and careers in this space.

The instructor, a former public defender with almost ten years of experience, has represented thousands of LGBTQ clients in criminal cases. Additionally, she established the first LGBTQ Defense Project within a public defender's office in the United States. The course will explore the widespread violence and discrimination that LGBTQ individuals encounter at each phase of the criminal legal process. We will explore specific questions, including: How does the criminal legal processâ€”encompassing policing, prosecution, pre-trial detention, plea bargaining, trials, sentencing, incarceration, and re entry effortsâ€”affect LGBTQ individuals uniquely? What structures in the criminal legal system permit the continuation of systematic violence against them? Additionally, we will examine the different strategies lawyers can employ in response to this injustice. The experiences of LGBTQ individuals within the criminal legal system will serve as a focal point for examining the wider debate between abolition and reform within social movements. This seminar will explore how insights gained from the treatment of this group can inform approaches to working within systems riddled with injustice. We will address how successful changes can significantly improve people's lives despite these systems making reform seem impossible. This seminar aims to foster the development of essential skills for students planning to pursue careers in criminal law; direct legal services; racial, gender or economic justice; or related fields, focusing on effectively representing LGBTQ clients. It will also offer a platform for students to engage in critical thinking about policy initiatives that could lead to harm reduction or justice for those marginalized individuals impacted by mass incarceration.

As the principal judicial organ of the United Nations (UN), the ICJ settles legal disputes submitted by states and provides advisory opinions on legal questions submitted by authorized UN bodies. The ICJ has long played a critical role in the development of international law regulating armed conflict and the use of force. But in recent years, the World Court has faced a growing number of challenging questions, including on issues related to belligerent occupation and reparations for violations of international humanitarian law.  This course will explore the ICJâ€™s major engagements with and contributions to public international law frameworks regulating armed conflict (jus in bello) and the use of force (jus ad bellum). Focusing primarily on the World Courtâ€™s jurisprudence, the course will explore how the Court has navigated some of the most challenging and contentious questions of law as it relates to: the customary rules and treaty provisions of international humanitarian law; the interplay between international humanitarian law and international human rights law in armed conflict; compensation for harms caused in armed conflict; self-defense and the jus ad bellum principles of necessity and proportionality; the legal frameworks regulating belligerent occupation; and the relationship between states and armed groups. Lastly, the course will consider ongoing ICJ cases related to armed conflict, providing students with the opportunity to grapple with how the World Court may contend with todayâ€™s most pressing armed conflicts.

Among other topics, weâ€™ll explore old-school legal realism, probe the question whether textualism and originalism are in fact one and the same thing or just close cousins, and dive into the subtle-but-important distinctions between clinical, dictionary-driven ordinary ""meaning"" and organic, on-the-ground ordinary ""understanding.""  Weâ€™ll likely explore the pros and cons of using both corpus linguistics and AI-based LLMs to unearth real-world understanding.

Has international law become more relevant than ever, or increasingly irrelevant? Is international law â€œall we haveâ€  in our tools of resistance, or is this moment an opportunity to look beyond it as we search for a vocabulary for global emancipation? This reading group aims to provide the tools to grapple with these pressing questions. As a group, we will strive to better understand the contemporary moment in international law. We will engage with works spanning international law, history, and political theory to build a framework for assessing both the depth of the current crisis and the range of reform projects on the table. Our focus within international law will include the laws of war, international economic law (trade and investment), international environmental and climate law, and international human rights law. Case studies will cover recent armed conflicts, trade wars, backlash against international investment law, climate change governance, and global human rights challenges. Each week will concentrate on a particular area of international law. Throughout, the group will use historical contingency as a lens for unpacking current international legal debates. In particular, we will pay close attention to alternative visions for structuring international lawâ€”projects proposed at different historical junctures but ultimately sidelined by the rise of the liberal international legal order. As we examine calls for reform or abandonment, these alternative imaginaries will help us grapple with the future of international law (and of law!) â€”both as a discipline and as a political language. No background in international law is required for this reading group.

This paper can be used to satisfy the analytical paper requirement for J.D. students. Prerequisite: None Exam Type: No Exam This course will offer students practical, real-world insights into the legal issues that command the attention of the general counsels of the three military departments at the Pentagon.  The mission of these military departments is to organize, train and equip forces for the warfighters.  The general counsels are responsible, under Title 10, to provide advice to senior civilian and military leaders in carrying out that mission. The course will cover ten topics: (1) civilian control of the military; (2) the acquisition of major weapon systems like the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter; (3) the sprawling National Defense Authorization Act and the process for submitting legislative proposals; (4) legal and policy considerations governing autonomous weapons; (5) fiscal laws applicable to the provision of military support to Ukraine and cost overruns within the nuclear enterprise; (6) security reviews and international matters; (7) environmental laws and the militaryâ€™s plans for remediating the fuel leak at the Red Hill facility in Hawaii; (8) the build out of the Space Force, the first new military service in nearly 75 years, amidst a rapidly-changing threat environment; (9) ethics, employment and personnel matters; and (10) the Presidentâ€™s â€œGolden Domeâ€  Executive Order to create a Next-Generation Homeland Missile Defense. Given the size and complexity of the Pentagon, strong project management and interpersonal skills are essential to advance large-scale initiatives.  The course will seek to foster these skills, which are transferable across career paths, by having students work in small teams to make oral presentations during the semester. The use of laptops, iPhones, and similar devices will not be permitted during class.

The institutions each movement sought to endâ€”chattel slavery and the contemporary carceral stateâ€”are also directly linked, by intersecting lineages and genealogies, and by the text of the Thirteenth Amendment, which outlawed slavery â€œexcept as a punishment for crimeâ€  and thus preserved the legality of American slavery to this day, within prisons.

It will meet throughout the year on an irregular schedule (dates TBD), and beyond framing classes with experts in the three areas of legal focus, will operate in a decentralized manner, with students working primarily with other students within their area of legal focus. If you would like to apply, send a CV and statement of interest to asmith@law.harvard.edu by Friday, August 29th.  Exam Type: No Exam As AI systems begin to exceed human capabilities, they enable broader and potentially unprecedented national security risksâ€”from AI-enabled bioattacks; to cyberattacks on power grids, financial networks, and communication infrastructure; to loss of control of advanced AI systems. The aim of this seminar will be to assess whether the U.S. government has adequate legal authority to prepare for, prevent, respond to, mitigate, or recover from these and other potentially grave scenarios, and if not, to identify legislative reforms that would correct any weaknesses so identified. The seminar will bring law students together with legal and policy experts to develop the legal critique. The class will be divided into three areas of legal focusâ€“cybersecurity, lawful governmental surveillance, and preparedness and response authorities, especially under the Defense Production Act. Experts with significant government experience will introduce seminar participants to each of these legal fields in a standard classroom setting and then students will dive deeper under a professorâ€™s supervision. Students will also participate in tabletop exercises and workshops facilitated by RANDâ€™s Technology and Security Policy Center to stress-test existing and proposed legal mechanisms in scenarios including AI loss of control and AI-enabled cyber incidents affecting critical infrastructure. Based on the initial classes, student research, and the tabletop experiences, students within each area will develop a rich understanding of existing statutory capabilities, and identify gaps in legal authority that weaken the opportunity of the executive to address AI risks. The objective in each section will be to craft a paper that identifies strengths and weaknesses within that domain, and proposes legislative reform as needed.

Exam Type: No Exam The law governing intelligence and national security issues can be difficult to understand without considering the context in which these questions arise, how legal advice is formulated, and the way in which government lawyers and clients make decisions on the challenging issues that arise in national security operations and policymaking.  Lawyers practicing in U.S. intelligence agencies play a significant role in agency decision-making but operate within a system of checks and balances that differs from other areas of legal practice.  Courts address national security legal questions infrequently in light of the classified nature of much of the work and threshold legal issues that often stand in the way of litigation.  This course is designed to teach students the law that applies to the operation of U.S. intelligence agencies, with a focus on CIA, by examining the dynamics between lawyers and the individuals they advise within the intelligence community and across the federal government.  In addition to providing a grounding in the relevant constitutional and statutory law and directives governing the intelligence community, the course will use case studies, both historical and hypothetical, to give students a sense of the experience of national security lawyering and policymaking. The course will cover a variety of key issues, including the roles of a lawyer in national security decision-making, the relationship between the executive and legislative branches, national security prosecution and litigation, balancing the need for both secrecy and transparency, and challenges posed by emerging technology, operational law advising, and evolving national security threats.",,Harvard Law School,,,Law School,Seminar,,HLS Graded,,,,

Liberalism and Its Discontents,HLS 3404,,2026 Spring,Full Term,,,,,,20926,227735,Instructor,,,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,"Prerequisites: None Exam Type: No Exam To its defenders, liberalism establishes the only workable way to govern a diverse society: pluralism and tolerance in the private sphere, political equality and the rule of law in the public sphere, and the free market as the primary mediator of material needs and wants.  But, critics contend, liberalism too often fails to defend its premises, and it lacks an internal theory of its limits.  Indeed, many of the most pressing debates in modern America seem to turn precisely on those questions that liberalism treats as pre-political: When is difference so offensive as to be intolerable, and when is it constitutive of a protected identity?   Who determines the preconditions for equal participation in a polity, and who can overrule them?  Which deprivations are too unjust to accept, and which are simply just deserts?  In this reading group, we will try to better understand these questions by looking to classic and contemporary Supreme Court opinions that grapple with them, as well as secondary sources that contextualize and deepen the debates.  Participants will be expected to complete all the assigned readings, submit a very short question before each session, and actively participate in group discussion.

Prerequisites: Students must have completed at least one of the following offerings: Environmental Law, Administrative Law, and/or Environmental Law Clinic. Exam Type: No Exam Federal environmental law is governed by a host of statutes enacted between the 1970s and 1990. These statutes are challenged by the dramatic and expanding scope of the climate crisis, the proliferation of toxics and plastics, and the biodiversity crisis. As Congress has struggled legislatively, some states have pursued innovative environmental legislation. This lab course introduces students to the legislative and regulatory drafting skill set. Competent legislative drafting is key to the future of federal and state environmental law.  The lab has three components:  The Classroom Component: Classroom exercises and discussions will focus on drafting best practices. Classroom discussions will also explore the need for new environmental legislation and the relationship between delegation, legislation, and regulation. State and federal legislators have different constraints and opportunities, and the course will explore when and how detailed statutory and regulatory text are deployed. In the federal sphere, particular attention will be paid to the changing administrative law landscape and what this means for legislative and regulatory drafting. Time will also be spent on ethical considerations and the political realities that influence outcomes. Expert Briefing and Discussion: The second component of the course will involve expert conversations and discussions in DC and Boston. Substantial time will be spent with experts on the legislative process in both Massachusetts â€“ where we will partner with the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection and MassWildlife â€“ and DC, where students will meet with lawmakers, Hill staff, lobbyists, NGOs, and members of the Office of Legislative Counsel and the Congressional Research Service. We expect to meet with members and staff from both political parties. We will be in DC from Sunday, 1/11 to Friday, 1/16. Course work: Each student will be required to submit a proposal for future state or federal legislation. This paper will satisfy the professional writing requirement. It is intended to be akin to a proposal that might be prepared by a lobbyist or public interest group.  Students will be provided transportation to and from Washington, D.C., as well as housing (students should plan to share rooms, subject to change based on guidance from Harvard or public health officials).

We engage in moral reasoning to learn what obligations we bear, in the throes of anthropogenic climate change, to benefit and to prevent harm to peoples and generations distant from us in space and time. Moral intuitions differ on recognition of distant persons as objects of moral concern. The urgency posed by occurrent climate change motivates work to construct a compelling understanding of what we collectively ought and virtuously would do. Candidate obligations are commonly expressed in terms of acts and forbearances to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions and to adapt to global warming. After surveying foundational topics debated by philosophers and economists—whether and at what rate future harms and benefits should be discounted, Parfit’s nonidentity problem, and carbon pricing—pragmatic reasoning will occupy center stage, as in quantifying how much mitigation may reasonably be expected from actions of individuals vis-a-vis actions of governments, and in anticipating the effects of alternative schemes for distributing the burdens of mitigation. Readings of recent works in moral philosophy and economics will draw students into grounding insightful positions on cogent arguments.

Negotiation,HPM  252,Linda Kaboolian,2026 Spring,Spring 2,,,,,,19269,190570,No Consent,,0,False,False,True,False,True,False,False,"The ability to negotiate successfully rests on a combination of analytic and interpersonal skills. Negotiators must execute promising strategies based on their analysis of the multitude of factors that affect the negotiation and that structure the definition of a successful outcome. Among these issues are the context and the structure of the negotiation, the interests of the other parties, the opportunities and barriers to creating and claiming value on a sustainable basis, and the range of possible moves and countermoves both at and away from the bargaining table, the value of the relationships, personal goals and ethical considerations. Interpersonal skills are important because negotiations are interactions with counterparts. Effective negotiators influence the behavior of other parties, correctly read the actions, intentions and preferences of counterparts, communicate their own perspectives and intentions well, and are aware of and can correct for their own cognitive and emotional biases. Strong interpersonal skills make it possible to execute one's own strategy and react to moves by counterparts effectively. This course will present conceptual frameworks that will help you analyze negotiations in general and prepare more comprehensively for future negotiations in which you may be involved. In class analysis of case studies and readings from applied game theory, social psychology, political theory, and behavioral economics, we will draw out lessons from ongoing, real-world negotiations. Through participation in negotiation simulations, you will have the opportunity to exercise your powers of communication and persuasion, and to experiment with a variety of negotiating strategies and tactics. The simulation exercises draw from a wide variety of contexts and their aim is to illustrate concepts and tools that apply to a variety of negotiations settings. In-class debriefs of your experience as well as your outcomes will help you make adjustments to your negotiating practice that better reflect your intentions and preferences. I hope that in addition to developing a better understanding of strategy, you will learn a great deal about yourself in this course. You will have repeated exposure to situations that involve a shifting mix of opportunities for cooperation and competition as well as important ethical choices. The main pedagogical perspective is to improve your own repertoire of action practice and by reflecting on your practice. As a result, your negotiating effectiveness should increase significantly. Overall, I expect that you will finish the course as an analytically savvy, flexible, efficacious negotiator.Registration Note: Students are required to attend class from the beginning of the term.

Improvement in health and health care outcomes has been agonizingly slow, but increasing global evidence and experience suggest that progress can be accelerated through a scientific approach to quality improvement. The purpose of this on-line course is to provide you with practical, yet rigorous methods and tools for tackling problems and getting results in public health and health care, or, in fact, for achieving credible results in any field where gaps between “knowing and doing” exist.This course uses engaging videos, personal improvement projects, and interactive assignments to teach the fundamentals of improvement science. We will emphasize a flexible and practical methodology, The Model for Improvement, but will crosswalk this model with other approaches you are likely to encounter, including implementation science, Lean, and Six Sigma. In addition, we will explore how methods from other scientific disciplines can accelerate improvement, especially epidemiology, qualitative and ethnographic methods, program design and evaluation, information and data science (including AI), and behavioral sciences and behavioral economics. You will practice what you learn by designing, implementing, and evaluating your personal improvement project. Course faculty will offer tips on performing rigorous, publishable projects as part of routine work (including how to differentiate between quality improvement and research that requires approval from institutional human studies review boards).

Organizing, in turn, requires leadership: accepting responsibility for enabling others to achieve shared purpose in the face of uncertainty.  Organizers ask three core questions:  1. Who are my people? 2. What is the change we need? 3. How can we turn our resources into the power we need to achieve that change? Organizers learn to identify, recruit and develop leadership, build community with that leadership, and create power from resources of that community.This practicum has two modes. During the first part of the course, Campaign Design, students participate in an 18-day “courseshop”, bookended by two 2.5 day weekend workshops during the weekends of TBD & TBD. Students learn with plenary lectures, small group practice and coaching. Requirements include consistent attendance, active participation, selected readings, a 600 word pre-module paper and a 700 word post-module paper. In the 12 days between the two weekend workshops this module will require approximately 15 hours of work (one-to-ones with constituents, team meetings, and meetings with your Teaching Fellow). In the second half of the course, Campaign Leadership, students participate in plenary sessions on Tuesdays and in sections on Thursdays, from TBD. In plenary, we focus on challenges that arise from running an organizing campaign, gain insights from cases, readings, lecture and discussion. In section, we coach each team’s practice leading their campaign as they meet new challenges and discover new opportunities. You will learn not only “about” these practices. You will learn to practice them experientially, coach others in the practice, and receive coaching yourself. We encourage a “growth mindset” for this practicum: try new things, take some risks, ask new questions. This practicum is for students interested in learning to create social change through collective action. There are no prerequisites to enroll in the course. Students with and without “real world” organizing experience can find the class equally useful. Students with a strong commitment to the community, organization, or values on behalf of which they are working will be most successful. Because it is a course in practice, it requires trying new things, risking failure, and stepping outside one’s comfort zone. As reflective practitioners, students learn through critical reflection on their experience, feedback, and coaching.

How have federal and state public policies influenced the frequency of hospital mergers, reconfigurations and closures? How does the arrangement of hospital systems affect access to acute care locally and nationally, in rural and in urban areas?

Instead, it is to enrich and clarify your own path by understanding the ""spiritual technologies""—the practices, mindsets, and rituals—that ground others. Paradoxically, this practice of looking outward is designed to strengthen, not dilute, your own worldview, fostering a deeper appreciation for your inherited traditions by seeing them in a new light.

A life-course perspective is essential in conducting epidemiological research, designing studies, and interpreting study findings. A life-course approach to the epidemiology of health and disease risk uses a multidisciplinary framework to understand the importance of time and timing associations of exposure and outcomes at the individual and the population level. It also offers a way to conceptualize how social, economic and behavioral determinants of health experienced at different stages of the life course, can differentially influence the development of diseases, as mediated through proximal biological processes. When conducting epidemiological studies, integrating a life-course perspective can help to clarify the research question, determine the study design, improve the study inferences, and thus render the study of a greater value for public health and clinical practice. Throughout this course, some historical background, theories of life-course epidemiology and examples of how various epidemiologic research questions can be embedded in life-course perspective will be discussed. Most importantly, epidemiologic methods and statistical approaches in addressing such challenges will be introduced all of which are related to time and timing of exposure and outcome.This course is designed to cover life-course epidemiologic concepts in different life periods, starting from intrauterine, intrapartum, childhood, adulthood, and old age, with an emphasis on the methods.

For data, this course covers the basics of data protection (through encryption, digital signatures and privacy regulations) and data attacks (including surveillance, doxing, and deep fakes). For code, we explore what software actually is, how programs are specified and certified, and unexpected behavior (including bugs, backdoors and malware). Finally, we’ll explore the world of computation (including the cloud, computing on the edge with Internet of Things, and AI). Cybersecurity is international, and this course will study cases from the US, Europe, China and Latin America. Students will help us achieve global reach by analyzing, discussing and presenting these complex topics in a variety of formats, including posters, presentations and short videos.",,Harvard Kennedy School,,,HKS Government,Lecture,To Be Determined,HKS Letter Graded,,,,

Reweaving Ourselves and the World: New Perspectives on Climate Change,IGA  453,Rebecca Henderson,2026 Spring,Full Term,,,,,,17433,223011,Instructor,,,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,"What does it mean to be alive and to be human right now? To what should we devote our lives? The world is on fire. War, faltering growth, huge investments in artificial intelligence, increasing political polarization, accelerating inequality and a global move towards populist authoritarianism are undermining economies and political systems across the planet. Meanwhile ecosystems are collapsing and global temperatures continue to increase, driving floods, droughts and fires, and threatening to make a significant fraction of the earth’s surface uninhabitable. How did we get here? How can we bear the feelings of grief, rage and powerlessness that opening ourselves up to what is happening often entail? Are we looking at collapse, or could this moment be laying the foundation for opening towards something new? I do not, of course, know the answer to these questions, but this class is for you if you’re looking for a highly interdisciplinary, collective conversation about them, pulling together students from across the university and leading-edge practitioners from a wide variety of fields. My experience has been that you are likely to learn at least as much from the other students in the room as from me.Drawing on a mix of readings, experiential practices and class visits from leading edge practitioners we will explore the idea that a loss of connection – to ourselves, to each other, and to the natural world – is at the root of our current crisis - and that doing the inner work necessary to address this disconnection could not only support us as individuals and communities but might also play a central role in driving broader transformative systemic change. Throughout the class we will explore what all this might mean for you – for the way you experience yourself, for how you frame the meaning and purpose of your life, and for how you decide to engage with the world. My hope is that you will leave the class with a supportive personal practice, a much richer sense for the levers that might drive transformative systemic change and some ideas as to what you might do with your own life. Class StructureIn addition to standard class discussion, most classes will also include some kind of experiential practice and many will include guests: people who are actively trying to integrate operating from a different way of being with concrete action on the ground. Participants will be asked to write a short reflection paper every other week, attend a weekly 90-minute section and participate in a (small) group project which will be presented in the last class.Admission is by application only, and applications are available from Fed Chavez, (Fchavez@hbs.edu).  Applications are being accepted until January 25.If you are interested in learning more, please request a copy of the syllabus from Fed Chavez at fchavez@hbs.edu.

The course begins with the recognition that energy has long been a major determinant of power in the international system and that every shift in global energy patterns has brought with it changes in international politics. IGA-412 explores how countries shape their grand strategies to meet their energy needs, as well as how such actions have implications for other countries and global politics. It looks at pressing contemporary issues related to peak oil, political reform and energy, pipeline politics, and the aggressive pursuit of oil and gas worldwide. The course also looks at new technologies and innovations - such as those making the extraction of shale gas economical or the growth of solar power - and how they are changing patterns of trades and could shape new alliances. Finally, IGA-412 considers the consequences of a successful shift away from petroleum based economies to anticipate how a new energy order will alter global politics in fundamental ways.",,Harvard Kennedy School,,,HKS Government,Lecture,To Be Determined,HKS Letter Graded,,,,

At the same time, global events — from Russia’s invasion of Ukraine to political instability in the Middle East — have made energy security a central concern for policymakers and investors alike. Artificial intelligence, powered by energy-hungry data centers, complicates this challenge further.Although the timing and technology mix of the energy transition remains uncertain, trillions of dollars in new investment will be needed, not only for wind farms, solar projects, and batteries, but for all infrastructure underlying the digital economy. Governments cannot meet these needs alone; private capital will play the decisive role. This course examines how public policy shapes private investment decisions in the global energy and infrastructure markets. Students will learn to build, understand, and use financial models to see how private investors assess risk and return. These tools will be applied to private sector projects ranging from energy generation and electric vehicles, to AI data centers or resource extraction for precious metals and rare earth mining.We begin with an overview of the world’s energy needs in light of the clean energy transition, diagnosing where money must be spent, what infrastructure is required, and how much it is likely to cost. Case studies will explore barriers to investment from the perspective of developers, governments, companies, financial firms, and multilateral development banks. The focus will then shift to how policies — such as carbon pricing, subsidy design, energy market reform, or development bank financing — affect financial viability and unlock private capital.",,Harvard Kennedy School,,,HKS Government,Lecture,To Be Determined,HKS Letter Graded,,,,

Smoke darkens the sky. Scorching heat. Violent storms. Mass extinction.In this perilous moment in human history, the world desperately needs leaders with the courage, drive and hardball political skills to fight climate change and help restore the natural world. Environmental leaders must also recognize how marginalized communities suffer disproportionately from pollution and climate change. Leadership is difficult in any enterprise, but it is especially difficult for environmental leaders who face opponents with vastly more power and money. In this course, students will learn three core skills to build power and advance environmental goals: Persuasion: Use persuasive speaking to inspire action. Build public support through print and digital media. Interpret scientific findings to a skeptical public. Advocacy: Build coalitions, mobilize activists, and lobby elected officials. Drive change through legislation, regulation and private markets.  Negotiation: Understand target point, reservation point, ZOPA, BATNA, interests vs. positions, creating value, and the role of relationships in negotiating complex, multi-party agreements.Students will develop these skills through negotiation simulations, role plays and case studies - all grounded in academic research, real-world lessons from global environmental leaders, and the instructor’s 30 years of on the ground environmental leadership. The course will explore the perspectives of government officials, NGO activists, business leaders and indigenous people in environmental conflicts. The simulations will include the international climate negotiations, the protection of tropical rainforests in Indonesia, the fight for sacred indigenous lands in South America, and the fight against worst polluter in Uganda. In the United States, the course will examine the battle over a toxic waste incinerator in an African American community, the negotiation of an Energy Bill, and the passage of the Clean Air Act.",,Harvard Kennedy School,,,HKS Government,Lecture,To Be Determined,HKS Letter Graded,,,,

Theater and Theatrical Culture in Early Modern Japan,JAPNLIT  262,David Atherton,2026 Spring,Full Term,,,,,,16083,226316,No Consent,,,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,"The Edo period witnessed the rise of two major theatrical forms—jōruri (puppet theater) and kabuki—that would exert an enormous impact on early modern culture. Both remain living performance genres today. Yet studying them as forms of early modern theater proves daunting. Both forms have undergone significant changes since the end of the Edo period (as, indeed, they transformed across the centuries of Tokugawa rule). And because performance is, by nature, ephemeral, reconstructing the dynamics and experience of an early modern play presents significant challenges. This is particularly true in the case of kabuki: a form for which the script (few of which survive) served primarily as a general outline for performances that could change significantly from one showing to the next. Yet both theaters left a wide range of traces in diverse media: playbills, actor critiques, actor and theater prints, objects, book illustrations, and theater-related books of all varieties, from satirical “audience critiques” to adaptations of plays into illustrated print fiction (kusazōshi). This seminar has three aims. First, it will introduce students to practical methods for studying early modern performance: familiarizing them with archives of theatrical ephemera, introducing strategies for accessing elements of performance from secondary materials, studying accounts of playwriting and performance by early modern playwrights and actors, and weighing the pitfalls and rewards of relying upon the conventions of modern performances. Second, it will invite students to understand early modern “theater” not only as a matter of performance, but as a broader cultural phenomenon that most people accessed not within the playhouse, but through secondary media like playbills, prints, critiques, merchandise, and fiction. And third, the seminar will delve into broader cultural, social, and political dimensions of theater in the early modern period, touching on such subjects as the relationship between the theater and the sacred; the theater’s relationship to early modern discourses of emotion; the body of the actor and the performance of gender; fan culture; the relationship between urban and rural theatrical culture; and the ongoing debate about whether early modern kabuki is better understood as a subversive or a conservative genre.

Understanding the history of Jews allows us to approach both North African and Jewish history from perspectives too often occluded by the standard historiographical narratives. Most Jewish history still centers on the Jews of Europe, especially after the medieval period. Yet across North Africa, Jews constituted some of the most vital and long-lived Jewish communities in the world.  And when we read about the history of North Africa and the Middle East, we tend to think about Muslims primarily, and perhaps Christians secondarily.

How similar are languages across modalities (signed/spoken)? Do the languages we know determine the thoughts we can think? Do we think (only) in language? Are there right and wrong ways of speaking? Who decides? What’s the difference between a language and a dialect? Where do our words come from? It’s said that more than half of the world’s languages and maybe as many as 90% are “endangered” and may no longer be spoken by the end of the century.

Cluster algebras are a class of combinatorially defined commutative rings that provide a unifying structure for phenomena in a variety of algebraic and geometric contexts. Introduced in 2001, cluster algebras have already been shown to be related to a host of other fields of math, such as quiver representations, Teichmuller theory, Poisson geometry, and total positivity. Cluster structures in Grassmannians have in particular been linked to integrable systems and physics. In the first part of the course I will cover the basics of cluster algebras and total positivity. In the second part of the class I will discuss recent developments and applications of the theory (topics could include the positive Grassmannian, the amplituhedron, KP solitons, etc).

The purpose of the course is to increase one’s capacity to lead with and without authority, across boundaries, and from any political or organizational position. In a world in which most organizations, communities, and societies face enormous adaptive pressures, the practice of leadership is critical – the practice of mobilizing systems of people to thrive in changing and challenging times. In this course, we apply theory to practice, clarifying the relationship among key concepts – leadership, management, authority, power, influence, followership, citizenship – to provide a practical and coherent theoretical framework. We develop both diagnostic tools for analyzing the complexity of change in social systems, and strategies of action. These action strategies include: using authority and power wisely, mobilizing responsibility across boundaries, managing economies of attention, generating innovation, building trust, orchestrating multi-party conflict, regulating disequilibrium, refashioning narratives to both build and depart from history, and building a culture of adaptability for the long-term.

They must be equipped with relevant personal competences interpersonal abilities to maintain productive relationships with difficult counterparts as they search for realistic compromises on programmatic options. These divisive tensions have been particularly visible in the response to recent crises, including during the COVID-19 pandemic, recent climate-fueled disasters and the various surges of migrants at the borders. Public officials and civil society organizations alike are not only expected to plan an adequate response to these crises but also to prevent and mitigate the risks of their instrumentalization by various political groups. These divisions and their exploitation on social media directly affect the capacity of governments to build the necessary consensus among stakeholders to put into place proper programs.To fulfill their role in such environments, policy professionals need to acquire specific capabilities to lead constructive engagements with a wide range of stakeholders from the most supportive to the most disruptive, while maintaining a degree of control over their message in this interconnected information world. Such capabilities involve the ability of building trust in a tense public arena and managing effectively adversarial relationships with actors opposed to the proposed policies. Engaging successfully with difficult counterparts is expected to become a crucial skillset of policymakers responding to all sorts of crises over the coming years.The main objectives of the course are:Develop a solid understanding of the social, behavioral and cognitive implications of political tensions in society and review conceptual frameworks related to conflict management in the public policy and public health domains;Provide students with core competences on complex negotiation informed by current practices from the political, public health and humanitarian sectors;Expand students’ skill set and enhance their self-confidence to engage in intense face-to-face negotiation with intimidating counterparts; and,Connect students with negotiation professionals from various sectors and offer opportunities to expand their personal network across this arcane domain.Through an experiential learning approach, the course will present a systematic methodology to engage in complex negotiations in a proactive, critical, and practical manner. It will offer practical tools to plan such negotiation as well as facilitate learning through student’s engagement with seasoned practitioners working in these complex environments. It will complement existing courses on public policy and leadership for those planning to work in high-intensity situations such as the current pandemic, social and political crises, climate shocks, natural disasters, armed conflicts and other critical situations.Please note, MLD-234M meets intensively over two weekends (March 28-29, 2026 and April 25-26, 2026).  See syllabus for details.",Also offered by the School of Public Health as GHP-243.,Harvard Kennedy School,,,HKS Government,Lecture,To Be Determined,HKS Letter Graded,,,,
PDIA in Action:  Development Through Facilitated Emergence,MLD  103M,Matt Andrews,2026 Spring,Spring 1,,,,,,17491,207096,No Consent,,,False,True,False,True,False,False,False,"Many policy experts use what we call plan and control methods to introduce new solutions into complex settings. The results are often limited. In many cases this is because the challenges in development are too complex to allow for effective planning or to support the success of ex ante strategies in reform or policy execution. In the face of such complex challenges, we believe that practitioners should be using more flexible facilitated emergence methods, where they focus on problems instead of solutions, move forward step by step (instead of following a long-term plan) and allow for flexible adaptation (instead of control-oriented implementation). Even though many development practitioners see the rationale behind this argument, and even agree that a more flexible approach is needed, they do not know HOW to pursue a process that is not based on ‘plan and control’. These practitioners often do not know what alternative methods involve. In response to this, the current course introduces students to a specific alternative approach to doing what we call facilitated emergence. This approach is called problem driven iterative adaptation (PDIA) and is the approach taken through the Building State Capability (BSC) Program at the Center for International Development (CID) at HKS. Students will engage in a short application of PDIA to get a feel for how one might do facilitated emergence, learning how to facilitate discussions about problems and potential solutions, engage with teams, and facilitate an iterative learning process.",,Harvard Kennedy School,,,HKS Government,Lecture,To Be Determined,HKS Letter Graded,,,,

At the conclusion of the course, students will have learned frameworks and concepts for thinking and communicating about conflict and have advanced their skills around disagreeing constructively both in their personal and professional relationships.The course will take place over two consecutive weekends in Spring I: February 6-8, and February 13-15, 2026. The class will meet 1:30-5:30 on Fridays and 10-6 on Saturdays and Sundays, with several breaks for movement and meals. The pedagogy will feature a mix of lecture, discussions, small group activities and simulations to give students the opportunity to both learn evidence-based insights from the social sciences and apply them to their own behavior. Given the interactive and discussion-based nature of the course, attendance at all sessions is mandatory.",,Harvard Kennedy School,,,HKS Government,Lecture,To Be Determined,HKS Letter Graded,,,,
Leadership Decision Making:  From Individuals to Institutions,MLD  308,Jennifer Lerner,2026 Spring,Full Term,,,,,,17464,170486,No Consent,,0,False,True,False,True,False,False,False,"From classical to contemporary times, two professional skills have remained indispensable for leadership: wise judgment and effective decision-making. Should we take the risky option or the safe one? Are we selecting the best talent? Are our choices ethical? How can we be sure? Are emotions distorting our perceptions? How should accountability be structured? How can machines best augment human performance? To what extent can leaders reduce worker stress while achieving organizational goals? And how can leaders empower employees and citizens to make sound, unbiased decisions?While this course will not decree what leaders should choose, it will address how leaders should choose—how to estimate risks, structure decisions, and apply scientific evidence to achieve rational choice in an uncertain world. It also equips leaders with tools for structuring public decision environments that can help everyone make better choices. The ultimate goal is to promote health, prosperity, security, justice, and well-being by helping individuals, institutions, and the public make wise judgments and timely, effective decisions that align with their objectives, especially in an era of increasing complexity and uncertainty. Specifically, grounded in theories and evidence from psychology, behavioral economics, neuroscience, and ethics, the course will enable students to: (1) Learn about the academic field of behavioral decision making, its major theories, results, and debates; (2) Become a critical consumer of scientific research findings, learning methodological standards for evaluating the soundness of empirical studies; (3) Develop the ability to effectively write and speak about behavioral science theories, results, and debates; (4) Acquire practical skills for improving your own judgments and decisions across a range of topics, including choices that involve value tradeoffs and deep ethical consideration; (5) Acquire knowledge of which biases individuals can fix with training/knowledge and which biases individuals cannot fix unless leaders engage in institutional and/or policy design (e.g., nudges); (6) Learn how to become “choice architects,” designing better judgment and decision environments in order to reduce bias and inaccuracy, making organizations smarter and fairer; and (7) Most important: Synthesize concepts/theories across topics, readings, and discussions to improve judgment and decision-making processes in the real world.","There are no specific prerequisites for this course. However, prior courses in psychology, behavioral economics (including MLD-304*), and statistics may be helpful. Cross registrants welcome.

Justice is only within our grasp when ushered in from a distant horizon of possibility---through study, imagination, and effort.”~Cornell William BrooksMany on the front lines of social justice fundamentally confront three issues that represent intersectional challenges demanding interdisciplinary public policy responses. Accordingly, this course takes up three themes: reparations, voting rights and criminal/legal reform or transformation. These three social justice challenges are often cited as the crumbling pillars propping up white supremacy and so many intersecting inequities. For generations, these racial challenges have obscured what is possible.  The projects of this social justice clinical represent the discrete public policy challenges identified by the multiple organizations and/or mayors on reparatory justice, voting rights, and criminal legal reform/transformation.  These organizations and affected communities undertake this work in a moment of unprecedented activism and advocacy, for which many of our forebears yearned.  This class is about rigorously exploring public policy and advocacy in service of justice through study and imagination.Working with the William Monroe Trotter Collaborative for Social Justice, municipal governments, as well as national/state advocacy organizations, a select cohort of students will work to address current injustices in real time—with a focus on what is demonstrably effective. Students will develop visions, strategies, and campaigns as well as legislative, policy, best practice, organizing, communication, and moral framing strategies to address injustices related to voting rights, reparations, and criminal legal reform. Students will employ advocacy principles such as moral ambition, perfect/imperfect victims, concentric/consecutive coalitions, and using scholarship as an organizing tool.Angela Davis, the activist, philosopher, and academic, reminds us that, “sometimes we have to do the work even though we don't yet see a glimmer on the horizon that it's actually going to be possible.” Those on the front lines of social justice fundamentally confront three issues that represent intersectional challenges demanding an interdisciplinary response.

Organizing, in turn, requires leadership: accepting responsibility for enabling others to achieve shared purpose in the face of uncertainty.     Organizers ask three core questions:  1.  Who are my people? 2.  What is the change we need? 3.  How can we turn our resources into the power we need to achieve that change?  Organizers learn to identify, recruit and develop leadership, build community with that leadership, and create power from resources of that community. This practicum has two modes.  During the first part of the course, Campaign Design, students participate in an 18-day “courseshop”, bookended by two 2.5 day weekend workshops during the weekends of February 20-22, 2026 & March 6-8, 2026. Students learn with plenary lectures, small group practice and coaching. Requirements include consistent attendance, active participation, selected readings, a 600 word pre-module paper and a 700 word post-module  paper. In the 12 days between the two weekend workshops this module will require approximately 15 hours of work (one-to-ones with constituents, team meetings, and meetings with your Teaching Fellow).  In the second half of the course, Campaign Leadership, students participate in plenary sessions on Tuesdays and in sections on Thursdays, from March 23 to May 1. In plenary, we focus on challenges that arise from running an organizing campaign, gain insights from cases, readings, lecture and discussion. In section, we coach each team’s practice leading their campaign as they meet new challenges and discover new opportunities.  You will learn not only “about” these practices.  You will learn to practice them experientially, coach others in the practice, and receive coaching yourself.  We encourage a “growth mindset” for this practicum: try new things, take some risks, ask new questions.  This practicum is for students interested in learning to create social change through collective action. There are no prerequisites to enroll in the course. Students with and without “real world” organizing experience can find the class equally useful. Students with a strong commitment to the community, organization, or values on behalf of which they are working will be most successful. Because it is a course in practice, it requires trying new things, risking failure, and stepping outside one’s comfort zone. As reflective practitioners, students learn through critical reflection on their experience, feedback, and coaching.

From lack of personal protective equipment to virus test kits to toilet paper, failures in supply lines are taking a toll on our lives.The efficient delivery of quality public services is a core requirement of government agencies. Supply chain management (SCM) is the structured approach for meeting this requirement. Supply chains are the systems and processes that transform resources into services ranging from healthcare to education to emergency response to criminal justice. Procurement, inventory, transformation, distribution, and transportation all must be managed individually and in concert with each other to achieve public policy objectives.Systems thinking, a holistic framework for understand how components of a system become an integrated, unified and optimized whole, is the foundation for effective SCM. Systems thinking ensures we understand the feedback loops that exist in supply chains and the non-linear nature of the real world. The empty grocery store shelves resulting from a demand spike in advance of a hurricane or blizzard illustrates how one change in the chain, an increase in demand, ripples through the entire system for weeks.This course provides students with the theory and practice to design, operate and sustain supply chains that deliver public services. We will explore both product chains (e.g. personal protective equipment for hospitals and school lunches) and service chains (e.g. the delivery of criminal justice and early childhood education).  The course begins with an exploration of the critical role of supply chains in service delivery through an examination of successes and failures. Next, the effective management of each link in the supply chain is studied. Then systems thinking is explained to see how comprehensive supply chains are designed and implementation requirements defined. The course concludes with an investigation of supply chains can be modified to achieve public purpose.The course pedagogy features case study and practitioner-based learning.

It takes Native American music and African music (recordings, writings about, notations of) as points of departure for understanding both what early scholars, missionaries and ethnographers were perceiving and felt motivated to describe in their writings. The pioneering Native American music scholar Alice Fletcher shared with Boas a connection with Frederic Ward Putnam at Harvard’s Peabody museum and inspired another remarkable female scholar, Frances Densmore, to conduct her groundbreaking work on native music across the US. The course will also take account the work of E. M. von Hornbostel, in light of his psycho-physical theories of music making, Hornbostel’s student Mieczyslaw Kolinski, whose scientifically oriented work spanned European, Native American and African topics, and Klaus Wachsmann, whose recordings and studies of musical instruments in Uganda and work as curator of the Uganda Museum proved useful to the next generation of ethnomusicologists working in Africa.

That is, music and politics are inseparable, even as music often proclaims its autonomy. In this seminar, we will ask: what are the means by which aesthetic products can be seen to relate to events, institutions, and ideological programs, and vice versa?  How broadly can and should the ""political"" be construed?  What are some of the different ways in which music been employed for political purposes during the twentieth century, and into the twenty-first? How do music's political associations change over time? What are the “flash points” – nodes of controversy and emotion – in discourse on music’s association with social and political contexts? We will do this by focusing on four composers/creators: Hanns Eisler, Luigi Nono, Bernice Johnson Reagon, and Anthony Davis. These represent different moments in history and different struggles. Eisler, as an Austrian-Jewish refugee from Naziism, used music and political theory to fight German fascism during World War II. Nono was an avant-garde composer and international activist in the global Cold War. Reagon activated singing as a powerful force in the U.S. civil rights movement and later founded chorus Sweet Honey in the Rock. American composer Anthony Davis, who will be in residence at Harvard during Spring ’26, has written influential operas that reflect on the soul of a nation. While learning about these specific political contexts, our main focus will be on the music. We will analyze a selection of works/creations by these artists as texts with much to say on their own terms. Readings will center on primary sources (theoretical texts, journalism, letters, manifestos, etc.) and will include some modern media theory and aesthetic theory. We will see some common themes across time, as well as real shifts and ruptures.  Every few weeks, you will be given the opportunity to present in class on a “political” musician/composer of your choice (from any era and any genre).This is a graduate-level seminar involving discussion, reading, listening, score study, and writing.",,Faculty of Arts & Sciences,,,Music,Seminar,,FAS Letter Graded,,N/A,N/A,Arts and Humanities

In this course, we study several philosophers, including Plato, Aristotle, the Epicureans, and the Stoics. We will examine and discuss their thinking on human nature and how we ought to live our lives, with an eye to understanding how and why, in the view of these philosophers, we ought to live our lives in certain ways and in pursuit of certain goals given what it is to be a human being. We shall, among other things, consider Plato’s thinking about death and the soul in the Phaedo; look at what the rationality of human nature means for the conduct of life according to Aristotle; discuss the Epicurean arguments against the fear of death; and investigate the striking claim made by the Stoics that being a good (virtuous) person is the only thing that matters in life.",,Faculty of Arts & Sciences,,,Philosophy,Lecture,,FAS Letter Graded,,N/A,N/A,N/A

Can we reconcile the idea of an objective ethical reality with evolutionary and sociological arguments that explain how we developed our beliefs? Is it strange that there can be facts that tell you what to do?We will begin by examining three famous arguments for an “anti-realist” metaethics: J.L. Mackie’s arguments from disagreement and from “queerness”, and Sharon Street’s “Darwinian dilemma”. All three arguments challenge the idea that our ethical beliefs reflect some kind of mind-independent facts. We will begin to develop philosophical skills through close analysis of these arguments, identifying their logical structure and the places where they could be challenged. We will then apply these skills to a series of texts defending alternative metaethical views, including reductive and non-reductive naturalism, quasi-realism, and constructivism. We will explore those four positions and the main challenges for each of them.

Our goal is to understand design practice as a dynamic and ever-changing pursuit in order to imagine practice futures; to use this research to create a bridge between discipline and practice.Within the cacophony of contemporary media, under the pressures of financial instruments, and with an expectation of artificial intelligence, this practice seminar looks to the past to explore the product of the architect as an artifact of circumstance, framing and projecting practice potentials now and into the future. Critically tracking the development of our practice, we will research design context, instruments of service, and representational formats as cultural and temporal constructs that limit or expand the role of the architect in practice. Our collective goal is an exploration of the relationship between – and the limits of – discipline, practice, and profession to better understand their structural potentials.Course content will be organized thematically, exploring the origins of contemporary practice and its products at any given moment – from built form to model to drawing to code – as the architect evolved from master builder to author to project manager. Legal and technical issues, client types, and structures of fee and control, will be considered. Students will develop critical positions on the renewed debate between empirical vs. cultural practice, on mediatic production and instruments of service for single projects vs. systems of design deployment and process design.In addition to lectures and discussion on research findings, guest panels from practice and related sectors will be assembled to add perspective to specific topics, particularly around the issue of emerging modes of production and instrumentation. Asynchronous formats will include pre-recorded lectures and one-on-one or small group research charrettes.Working individually or in pairs, students will research a specific type of architectural production in relationship to its evolution within the discipline and practice. Students will synthesize their topical research within a shared research framework to yield a collective research publication. Final course output will aggregate and draw from this collective knowledge to speculate on the future product of the architect.There are no prerequisites for this course, which is intended as an interdisciplinary discussion. While this course is focused on the evolution of the product of the architect, the emergence and co-evolution of the related disciplines of landscape architecture, urban planning, and urban design are essential to the conversation.This research seminar traces the dynamic dance between the shape of design practice and the society it serves through the lens of the defining media and practical instruments of our time, the ""products of practice."" Through an engagement with history, theory, and the mechanics of everyday practice, the course aims to frame structural change within practice and for the role of the architect in society in order to prepare students to innovate, define, and lead future design practice.",,Graduate School of Design,,,Architecture,Discussion-based Seminar,In Person,GSD Graded,,,,

One is the philosophical tradition focused on ideas of self-reliance, self-construction, and nonconformity (exemplified by Emerson and Nietzsche).

These dangerous ideologies often masquerade as environmental consciousness.While contemporary discussions frame such rhetoric as a reaction to the growing awareness of climate change, it has deeper historical roots, particularly visible in American religious writings. Lest we forget that religion (and race) were central to the ecofascist manifestos espoused by the perpetrators of several tragic events: the 2019 Christchurch mosque shootings in New Zealand, where a gunman targeted Muslims during Friday prayers at Al Noor Mosque and Linwood Islamic Center; the 2015 mass shooting of Black churchgoers at Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, South Carolina; the 2019 Walmart shooting in El Paso, Texas that targeted the Latinx community; and the 2022 attack at a grocery store in a predominantly Black neighborhood in Buffalo, New York. In the manifestos, the shooters identified as ecofascists whose mission was to protect and preserve white Christian nationalism in the wake of climate disaster.The manifestos accompanying these attacks have brought greater visibility to ecofascism today, compelling us to examine its historical roots and current operations. Is there a longer history of American religious ecofascism? How can we characterize this history, and what insights does it provide into the functioning of ecofascism in contemporary society?

Krishna and Christ: Does it Matter?,RELIGION   64,Francis Clooney,2026 Spring,Full Term,,,,,,20417,208033,No Consent,,,False,True,False,True,False,False,False,"Krishna, a supreme deity of Hindu tradition, and Jesus Christ, the central figure of Christian faith, have been compared and contrasted for well over two centuries. They been understood as similar divine persons, who descend into this world and are embodied here, gather followers, offer wise instructions, save their devotees, and are best approached by love and devotion. But differences have often been emphasized. For centuries, missionaries, scholars, and many ordinary believers have seen Krishna and Christ as competitors., pushing similarities and differences in contexts (most often in India but not only) where true religion, salvation, and conversion were at stake. Questions arose such as these: Are Krishna and Christ mythical or historical figures? The former mythical and the latter historical? Is either divine? Both? Did they truly come into this world, by incarnation or avatara? If they save, how does that happen – and save from what? Are they moral role models? Can a Hindu love Christ, and a Christian love Krishna? Such were “hot” questions for a very long time, and even today for some. But for many, such questions have lost their urgency in the 21st century. It is good that competition is largely a thing of the past, but it may not be good that the urgency of the comparison — Krishna and Christ, Christ or Krishna? – no longer matters to most people. Do we have something to gain by taking both Krishna and Christ seriously?

The course will take up questions such as these: What does it mean to call something “religious”? Is the category of “religion” a universal feature in human life, or more historically specific? What is at stake in defining this category in one way or another? How do claims about religion relate to claims about politics, economics, culture, and society? The course will also enable students to evaluate the choices that scholars make about what to privilege in their investigations.  The course emphasizes critical reading and thinking skills, as well as thoughtful participation in discussion and the refinement of students’ academic writing.","Required of all concentrators, and recommended for Secondary Field students.

In addition to acquainting themselves with the traditional methods of Pāṇini’s tradition as taught by Varadarāja, students will learn how to use online platforms, multimedia, modern commentaries, and other materials that help find and identify the steps of form derivation (prakriyā).

Students learn how to analyze kṛt and taddhita suffixes, recognize a variety of poetic meters, categorize and take apart compounds in greater detail, and determine the various senses in which kārakas and vibhaktis are being used. In the final month of the course, students learn how to interpret commentarial and expository prose (śāstra). In addition to developing the discrete skills above, students read and discuss three different Sanskrit texts. We continue the story that we began in the fall semester—that of the encounter between Arjuna and Śiva in book 3 of the Sanskrit epic Mahābhārata. Then we study Bhāravi’s Kirātārjunīya, a sixth-century kāvya (poetic) composition based on that epic story. Finally, students practice their commentary-reading skills by interpreting select portions of Mallinātha’s Ghaṇṭāpatha, a fourteenth-century commentary on the Kirātārjunīya. Overall, the intermediate-level Sanskrit course enables students to interpret Sanskrit texts in three major genres: epic, poetry, and scholarly prose. Students expand and strengthen the skills in reading comprehension, grammatical analysis, and vocabulary retention that they developed during the first year of study. Students will be able to dissect and describe nominal compounds, verbal forms, poetic meters, and morphological and syntactical features of Sanskrit words, sentences, and verses in greater detail.

Much of the class will revolve around active discussion of readings, both in the popular and public health press, and at least four case studies. Each class will be explicitly organized around a case study and/or a lesson learned, some will be new ones, others will hopefully expand upon earlier SBS lessons. Overall, this course aims to facilitate opportunities for students to read seminal pieces, contribute to avid discussions on a wide range of public health topics, and expand individual interests. It also seeks to encourage students to grapple with individual and collective lessons from major public health campaigns to build for more improved ones going forward. Accordingly, although the course focuses on cancer prevention initiatives, students should feel free to apply lessons learned to their areas of interest in their assignments. Course Objectives:  1. Critically synthesize and evaluate criteria for successful population-wide interventions in population health improvement, including cancer control  2. Carefully critique the key components of historically successful large-scale cancer control interventions both for US and internationally (tobacco, skin cancer prevention, SSB laws)  3.

The sessions include readings regarding the experiences of Black Americans, Burakumin people, Dalit people, Jewish people, Romani people, Palestinians, and other oppressed and racialized peoples.This is an introductory course examining four main topics to be discussed in separate but interconnected sections: (1) Racism and other systems of oppression; (2) racialized and gendered poverty; (3) power; and (4) institutional and societal responses to racism and other oppressions.Racism and other systems of oppression: In this section, we will discuss systems of oppression enforced across various regions of the world. This section pays particular attention to the impact of enduring systems of oppression on access, quality, and outcomes in education and health.Racialized and gendered poverty: The existing measures of poverty provide a necessary but insufficient picture of socioeconomic injustices. International and national institutions operate with robust and assessable frameworks (e.g., multidimensional poverty index or absolute poverty). Yet, these frameworks fall short in capturing the determinants and dimensions of structural socioeconomic inequities (e.g., multigenerational wealth, neighborhood poverty). Thus, in this section, we will not only discuss the concepts of poverty and multidimensional poverty, but also explore ways to measure intersectional, racialized, and gendered poverty.Power: Scholarship on systems of oppression frames them not only as matters of rights deprivation for marginalized groups but also as inherited advantage in power for dominant groups. In this section, we will discuss whether and how inherited power is transmitted economically, socially, culturally, and ideologically.Solutions: In this final section, we will examine examples of interventions (both successful and ineffective) aimed at addressing structural inequities.

The translation from design to realization is mediated by a range of tools and processes whose development is informed over time by material properties, skill, technology, and culture. As a whole, these systems are the vehicle by which design teams, manufacturers, installers, and ultimately users engage the materiality of architecture. Parallel technological developments relating to the way in which things are designed (digital modeling, simulation, generative design, etc.) and the way things are made (automation, computer-controlled equipment including robotics, advanced materials, etc.) have afforded new opportunities and challenges related to the realization of new forms in architecture, part customization, user-centered design, and enhanced building performance. Within this context, this year’s course positions ceramic material systems as a vehicle for exploring applied research methodologies and investigation into the opportunities (and challenges) afforded by digital fabrication techniques. Building on a long-term collaboration with the Harvard Ceramics Studio in Allston, this course will advance strategies for robotics, additive manufacturing, and other computational fabrication technologies.Ceramics are the first material created by humankind and are produced across scales and applications from the craft-studio to high-volume, automated manufacturing environments. Pleasing to the touch and easily manipulated by hand, it can also be subject to digital technologies and robotic approaches.

Topics move on to geomorphology; the process of grading and contour manipulation; the conventions of grading representation, terminology and communication in the construction industry; as well as accessibility codes. The second part of the course focuses on water quality and quantity, introducing techniques used to calculate the amount of water flowing over a site and the various ways that the topography can be manipulated to slow, convey, filter, collect or disperse water to help improve its quality and control water flow emanating from a range of storm events. The case studies and precedents presented throughout the course help to illustrate a broad range of approaches to problem solving and the act of sculpting the land. This course focuses on the agency of landform and water flow in the creation and design of landscape. At the end of the course, students will be able to manipulate contours toward a given intention and will understand the factors that contribute to stormwater volumes and flows and ways to embrace and incorporate those factors toward a desired design intent.  During this course, students will learn to:- Read the land and water, manipulate contours and become familiar with conventions for drawing and communicating intents- Design topography for human experience- Collect and clean stormwater- Support living systems.The course is taught as a series of lectures and individual, short-term exercises that focus on core competencies, and one longer-term design exercise.  Live lectures will be supplemented with asynchronous resources such as pre-recorded lectures, recordings of select class lectures, and written primers. Instructors anticipate that some shifts may be required during the term to respond to yearly shifts in student needs. Each week will typically include two class sessions of 1.25 hours each (2.5 hrs total), consisting of one lecture session attended by all students, and one ‘section’ session dedicated to a smaller group of students. Section sessions typically will be dedicated toward questions and deeper dives into the ongoing assignments, and some time to work on assignments. MLA I and AP students will be divided equally into each section. Assignments will require additional time outside of class. Assignment deadlines are focused on the first half of term, and sections toward the end of term are more focused on lectures and visiting lecturers.Prerequisites: Experience drafting 2-dimensional plan and section drawings to scale in Autocad or Rhino.",,Graduate School of Design,,,Landscape Architecture,Lecture,In Person,GSD Graded,,,,

Today’s new buildings can be designed and built to operate without using fossil fuels, without emitting CO2 into the atmosphere, but their construction threatens to remain a growing source of carbon emissions. Can biological materials provide the answer? This seminar will explore biologically derived material systems ranging from plants and plant fibers to fungi, bacteria and other microorganisms. Our focus will be on buildings and consumer products, with consideration of the larger landscape and geographical scale. Through in-class lectures, case studies, and hands-on workshops, students will be exposed to some of the new biomaterials that are being developed at the intersection of material science, biology, and design. Other lectures will trace the impact of these material systems on the climate, explore the landscapes of production and their ecologies. The seminar will explore the embodied impacts of our material world and take a critical look at the production of bio-based materials and their geochemical flows. Students will explore various ways of fabricating prototypes with these biomaterials, seeking to understand how new regimes of real-time sensing may be overlaid onto these methods to gain new insights into the material. Students will be required to develop a term project of their choosing in teams relating to issues raised in the course at any scale – be it new material development, new fabrication processes, the design of a circular material economy, or an investigation into landscapes of production.

Recognizing this crisis, the United Nations declared this decade (2021-2030) the UN Decade of Ecosystem Restoration. In this course, we will explore the principles of ecology that are fundamental to the goal of ecosystem restoration, including restoring ecological function and structure to degraded lands. We will discuss these concepts across multiple ecosystem types (e.g. wetlands, coasts, forests, deserts), scales (e.g. parcels, regions, continents), and landscape contexts (e.g. urban, agricultural, landfills, mines). In doing so, we will address a series of interrelated questions that will help determine how we implement ecosystem restoration and what we restore these landscapes to:  What are the ecological processes of functioning communities, both plants and animals, that can be reinstated on degraded lands? What are the constraints to restoring natural communities (soil, species availability, interactions among species, changed physical environments)? How can restored habitats be integrated into landscape architecture and urban planning? What social and political hurdles must be overcome to advance an ecosystem restoration agenda?The seminar will be structured through lectures, case studies, and class discussion. Throughout the semester we will invite ecologists and practitioners to share their insight from restoring ecosystems worldwide. We will have field trips to local restoration sites and meet the designers and managers overseeing these projects. Each student will be asked to develop and present on an independent research project or an ecological restoration plan on a site of their choosing. Through these class activities, students will be provided with the understanding and tools to support, design, and monitor ecosystem restoration through their discipline. The course will be open to students from the GSD and Organismic Biology. The readings, lectures, and discussion will integrate the perspectives of both ecology and design.

This course starts from the premise that it would not be ethical to design cities without creating meaningful conversations with different stakeholders. Our main challenge is to improve the quality and ethics of design work by staying in close contact with the city and its residents.Participation is a way of confronting our preconceptions, revealing our blind spots, and/or supporting our intuitions in a context where architecture, urbanism, and other design-related fields are becoming more and more complex and multilayered. Participation is not an end, it is a means: a powerful tool that establishes new connections and boosts both creativity and the production of new ideas. Likewise, participation allows the construction of a collective dialogue that will engage people in different ways, formats, and temporalities. Participation is a method to enable the creation of more democratic, inclusive, and open-ended environments, redefining the very concept of citizenship.– How can designers reimagine participatory decision-making processes?– How should design participation unfold in an ever-changing reality?– What improves communication and enhances creative dialogue?– Can participatory design lead to open-ended processes or outcomes?Among other strategies deployed to answer these questions, the class will focus on the potential contribution of digital technologies as a means for linking participation to design. Technology opens new opportunities for revealing multiple layers of meaning. It also allows the exchange of information and creation of new possibilities that together can transform the way we behave. Technology, in short, enables us to better relate and interact with each other and our surroundings, thus lowering the barriers for citizen engagement.Throughout the semester, we will look for alternative means and untapped opportunities to identify and develop socially and technologically innovative approaches, methodologies, and tools.

Creating Environmental Markets,SES 5447,"Robert Zimmerman, Lorena Bello Gomez",2026 Spring,Full Term,,,,,,19561,220636,No Consent,,,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,"There is a way out of the climate box we have created, though resistance to the necessary ecological transformation remains intense. Sunk investments in existing infrastructure, broadly accepted design and economic theory, and the lifelong operations employment it has provided make the foundation of such resistance. Creating Environmental Markets will examine alternative capital markets based in regulatory requirements but offering opportunities to use credit trades and new approaches to old systems to restore ecology while providing economic incentives and jobs.The climate problems we once anticipated have become a connected series of current crises: intense heat, extended drought, potable water shortages, almost spontaneous fires, floods, food shortages, enormous tornadoes and hurricanes, acute cold.... The prognosis for the coming decades is that these phenomena will get worse, yet our responses remain mostly mundane. We repair, rebuild, extend, and expand essentially the same 19th Century energy and water infrastructure that put us in this climate box, evidently expecting a different outcome.If we are to meet and overcome the climate challenges we have created, incentivizing environmental restoration over broad landscapes, from individual site designs to entire cityscapes, is essential. The law as currently interpreted will not save us, but some combination of law and regulation together with markets creating economic incentives favoring ecological restoration of natural systems could. In addition to recognizing the damage we have done we need a clear conception of required ecological repair. Students will be introduced to that clear conception while examining a regulation-based market to incentivize ecological repair at scale, fostering the necessary energy and water infrastructure change.  This class is intended for MLA, Planning, and Design students. Their skills provide them the insights necessary to make such markets work. Students will investigate Providence, RI, to determine whether infrastructure change and a credit market would help the city meet its regulatory obligations to control Combined Sewer Overflows (CSOs) and Municipal Separate Storm Sewer Systems (MS4s). Intended to incentivize the restoration of natural systems, the investigation and designs would also lead to enhanced flood control, resilience to drought, and restored habitat. Students will also work with city officials, producing a report on their findings and recommendations. Working with Blue Cities Design, they will assess the damage existing infrastructure has caused, examine the benefits and potential for restorative change, and take a hard look at the relationship of the watershed with the city.",,Graduate School of Design,,,Landscape Architecture,Discussion-based Seminar,In Person,GSD Graded,,,,

The business model and investment objectives of capital purveyors depend on a variety of factors. Case studies will be used to highlight key real estate investment concepts such as identifying opportunities, public/private valuations, distressed investing, risk management, asymmetric investments, and alignment of interests.  Industry experts will discuss the current macro environment, key market concerns, capital availability, cost of capital, acquisition and development economics, and opportunistic and thematic investment strategies.

Do No Harm: Dilemmas in Planning for Health,SES 5464,Magda Maaoui,2026 Spring,Full Term,,,,,,20860,223865,No Consent,,,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,"Planners have long imagined themselves as physicians attending to the good health of cities and the communities living in them. Do No Harm unpacks the complex connections between environmental health, public health, and city planning. The course title, a nod to both the Hippocratic Oath and the creed of social reformer Florence Nightingale, represents a challenge to students preparing to manage the discrete, conflicting interests of that most complex of organisms—the metropolis. This class uses housing as a starting point for a sectional slice of inquiry that spans from the underground to the air that surrounds us. We will discuss how the design, policy, geography, ownership model, and maintenance of housing influence various public and environmental health metrics, and what levers are available to planners to influence those outcomes. We will explore and evaluate tools of assessment and intervention and identify points of leverage. Within this framework, students are expected to bring their own interests, disciplines, and experience to bear on a semester where our focus will range from affordable and simple tools at the housing-health nexus (smoke detectors, mosquito nets) to more complicated questions of ethics, objectives, and priorities. Together we’ll consider the nexus between health and planning as an ongoing process of experimentation, monitoring, learning, and adaptation, with the aim of constantly improving the conditions that promote health for all populations, but with a particular focus on improvements that alleviate the inequities currently experienced by segregated and disinvested communities around the world.The class will be divided into two streams—input and action. In the input part of the class students will study famous and infamous stories about how our decisions can harm or heal communities, such as Haussmannian hygienist efforts in France, the rise of air-conditioning in Global South cities, or slum clearance in the United States. In the action component groups of students will develop an approach to addressing a real problem in a real place, using housing as a lever for better health. These may be speculative or tailored for a client who works at this nexus between planning and health (the Parisian Roofscapes). These outputs may take the form of written reports, graphic visualizations, or creative endeavors which students will refine and pitch at midterm and final presentations.  We'll ask: What are the key health issues that should concern those in planning and related fields? Can physical design and planning alone improve health? In a world of finite resources, how do we weigh competing priorities and evaluate the costs and benefits of our interventions? Do we need values systems to guide or restrain technocratic evidence-based approaches? Where are the limits of our responsibility for health outcomes in our jurisdictions? This course will equip you with the understanding, vocabulary, and tools you need to make health a part of your future practice, whether you become a housing advocate, a land use planner, a developer, an urban designer, a transportation planner, or some other role entirely. For those who come from the world of public health and environmental policy, you will gain new insight into the powers and politics that enable and constrain planners, architects, and other practitioners in the city.",,Graduate School of Design,,,Urban Planning & Design,Lecture,In Person,GSD Graded,,,,

The course’s critical approach to case studies and policy prescriptions will also prepare students to formulate relevant planning strategies in the future. Among a range of policy domains, special attention is paid to transportation, housing, mega-project development, land policy, and environmental sutainability, with most examples drawn from Latin America, South and East Asia, and Africa.",,Graduate School of Design,,,Urban Planning & Design,Lecture,In Person,GSD Graded,,,,

From urban centers in North America and Europe to cities in Africa, Asia, and Latin America, students will delve into the factors that shape housing systems globally as they face complex intractable crises.A unique feature of this course is the opportunity to work in tandem with the New York based organization Urban Design Forum. Students will be paired with groups of Forum fellows as they set out to analyze international housing contexts and extract valuable lessons for addressing New York City's ongoing housing crisis. The collaboration focuses on critical UDF themes such as unleashing supply, planning for neighborhood mix, adapting homes, building for demographic shifts, energizing social housing, and embracing housing for all. This provides students an extraordinary chance to apply theoretical knowledge to real-world challenges, fostering innovative thinking and practical problem-solving skills.Throughout the course, we will analyze key innovative models in affordability, sustainability, governance, and social equity. Students will engage with a variety of case studies, policy transfer stories, and theoretical frameworks to understand how housing solutions have long been influenced by local, national, and transnational priorities.In class, we will divide our time between input and action. In addition to our work with the Urban Design Forum, each week, we will (1) discuss essential readings in comparative housing studies, and (2) recognize how planners should draw more profound lessons from a multi-scalar comparative perspective, across South-South as well as North-South experiences.This class is ideal for those interested in urban planning and design, public policy, sociology, environmental planning, and international studies.Learning Outcomes:Develop a comprehensive understanding of global housing systemsCritically analyze and compare housing policies and practices across different regionsEvaluate the role of housing in promoting or hindering social equity, better health outcomes, and environmental justiceSynthesize cross-cultural perspectives to address housing challengesCollaborate with industry leaders as they engage directly with ongoing efforts to transform New York City's housing landscape.",,Graduate School of Design,,,Urban Planning & Design,Project-based Seminar,In Person,GSD Graded,,,,

It will examine how institutional structures and legal rules provide the sources and limits to planning authorities in different societies, and how planning systems regulate urban and regional issues through different approaches. Four national planning prototypes will be specifically addressed in the course: American, British, German, and Chinese, but comparisons from other countries will be drawn on certain topics. Students will be encouraged to explore such comparisons in their targeted countries or city regions.The main objective of the course is to enhance students’ understanding of the ways that planning functions in different regimes and the tensions being resolved between the requirements of public welfare provision, private property rights, sustainable growth, justice, and urban planning. At the heart of the discussion lies an acknowledgment that planning is not a single process with a universally accepted outcome, but divergence and convergence happen across different systems, and comparison is instrumental to understanding their development.The course will begin with three fundamental factors that shape the structure of planning regulation:  a society’s attitude toward property rights, the role of national and local governments and their relationship to each other, and the different nature of legal frameworks. Then the course discussion will cover a series of topics with a comparison of different approaches by different countries traditionally and how they evolved:Zoning and development controlComprehensive planning and growth managementHistoric preservationUrban renewal Provision of urban and regional infrastructureHousing supply and affordabilityEnvironmental protection and climate justicePublic participation, dispute resolution, and judicial review",,Graduate School of Design,,,Urban Planning & Design,Lecture,In Person,GSD Graded,,,,

Migration as Adaptation: Planning for Real Receiving Communities,SES 5518,Hannah Teicher,2026 Spring,Full Term,,,,,,19569,225665,No Consent,,,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,"In an era of accelerating climate disruption, people are increasingly on the move. This is largely due to forced displacement after extreme events but can also be a result of proactive migration in search of relief from chronic environmental stressors. Cities have become the receiving places for most of this relocation. Some have received rapid influxes of newcomers after nearby disasters, while others have seized an opportunity for economic development, branding themselves climate refuges and trying to attract people and businesses on that basis.As cities grapple with the fallout of climate mobility and try to leverage opportunities where they arise, policymakers and academics have been debating the potential of this migration to serve as adaptation. Migration may be adaptive when people are at least as well off after relocation as they were before. A stronger case can be made when receiving communities not only integrate newcomers but also build climate resilience into infrastructures and services. However, there is always a risk that touting migration as adaptation covers for the failure to adapt in places that are typically marginalized and disinvested.This seminar will engage with the full landscape of receiving communities for climate migrants while attending to major theoretical debates on the topic. Even with this focus, we will proceed on the basis that migration has complex drivers. Economic, political, and climate conditions are intertwined, and climate may not be the most salient factor to migrants themselves or the communities and cities that receive them. However, climate migration presents unique challenges given the pervasiveness of environmental disruption, meaning that no place is safe from climate change. Climate mobility and receiving communities are real and growing, and they require attention in practice.Students will grapple with this through two complementary parts of the seminar: 1. A foundation in the field through readings and discussion of major topics and 2. Case studies of receiving communities to be provided as a deliverable to a real-world client. The course will delve into major topics including migration as adaptation, equity and justice in relocation, limits to adaptation and maladaptation, debates over livability and immobility, voluntary and involuntary migration, and immigration and refugee law and policy for climate mobility. Students will put these concepts into practice, conducting case studies of domestic and international receiving communities for the Climigration Network to support their work with community partners seeking to understand enablers of relocation. Through the two complementary parts of the course, students will have an opportunity to be at the cutting-edge of practice while engaging thoughtfully with the full complexity of underlying climate migration challenges.",,Graduate School of Design,,,Urban Planning & Design,Project-based Seminar,In Person,GSD Graded,,,,

As the bay emerges as the Atlantic gateway for exports from Vaca Muerta, the world’s second-largest shale gas reserve, students will consider whether and how local capacities might endure beyond the boom. How can productive diversification strengthen long-term sustainability? Combining spatial analysis, policy design, and research-based writing, students will explore strategies that can improve quality of life and meet local expectations. In order to produce an integrated territorial diagnosis that weaves together social, economic, environmental, and institutional dimensions, students will build projects through critical readings, comparative case studies, and mapping exercises. The seminar approaches the bay both as a productive landscape and as a social system in transition, working with public officials, scholars, and local actors students to chart the institutional and spatial ecology of the region. Beyond identifying land-use and expansion scenarios, priority investments and infrastructure, and governance arrangements capable of sustaining benefits beyond the energy cycle, student projects will lay the groundwork for a digital publication synthesizing the seminar’s outcome by combining maps, visual narratives, and concise analytical essays into a coherent whole.

Students will examine how businesses can address material risks – from climate shocks and regulatory pressures to stakeholder expectations – while identifying opportunities to build resilience and competitive advantage through sustainability.This module course goes beyond exploring why sustainability matters, focusing on how to enact effective sustainable strategies. Students will learn to identify and evaluate material environmental and social risks for organizations, measure and assess current sustainability efforts, and determine an organization’s existing strategy for addressing environmental and social risks. Students will develop an understanding of the institutional forces and systemic issues that shape organizational behavior, enabling them to design strategies that both mitigate risk and create long-term value.

In November 1969, a group of Indigenous activists occupied Alcatraz Island, claiming that a 1851 treaty required retired federal lands to be returned to Indigenous peoples. Since early colonization and to the present, Americans have practiced ‘squatting’ to claim lands and spaces as their own, even without legal title. These are very different events, but they share a common theme. Each prompt us to consider the central importance of spatial belonging and situatedness to political life. What did the land mean to these people? What does it mean to us? What is it, exactly, that we are demanding when we demand a space for our own? This class will address these questions with interdisciplinary readings on the relationships we form toward the land. Our goal is to not isolate abstract scholarship, but instead to examine the connections between theory and praxis, and to highlight how we can apply the theories we discuss in class. Toward that end, the class will be organized around 5 modules, foregrounding present-day and historical movements, following by theoretical reflections.

How might we bring these wider histories and relations into understandings of contemporary migration? How do inherited social worlds shape processes and practices of migration? Drawing on texts and theories core to contemporary migration studies across global diaspora and those immediate to us in Massachusetts, this course will examine the multiple forms that displacement can assume and how social scientists have conceptualized them. Key themes will include labor/work, the production of borders and their performance beyond border zones, im/mobility and il/legality, generation, and kinship. We will ask how wider histories shape how knowledge is produced, what narratives are told, and how the local and global are rendered knowable.

Yet recent phenomena, including rising polarization, the spread of bizarre conspiracy theories, and the proliferation of online misinformation, challenge this assumption. They raise the possibility of differences in perspective that are irreconcilable and non-eliminable. How should democratic societies respond to the proliferation of seemingly incompatible belief systems throughout the public? And, what does it mean to be an informed citizen in this fragmented informational environment? This tutorial examines these questions by combining empirical research on public opinion with theoretical approaches from social and political epistemology, ordinary language philosophy, and political theory.

It will consider classic works such as Durkheim’s On Suicide, Foucault’s Madness & Civilization, Freud’s Civilization & It’s Discontents, Fanon’s Wretched of the Earth and Kleinman’s Patients & Healers. We will ask how these theories relate to vexing modern problems at the interface between society mental health including the opioid epidemic, deaths of despair and teen mental distress. We will also consider problems in subjective wellbeing, such as why humans do not seem to be happier with the material progress of commercial society (the Easterlin Paradox). The course begins with the challenges: an overview of biomedical and epidemiological consensus on mental illness classification, risk factors, and known epidemiological characteristics. It moves through a close reading of how several key social theorists have located and characterized important relationships between mental health and society, building on the study of these thinkers in Social Studies 10. It then considers important ethnographic work from Anne Becker, Philippe Bourgois, and Matthew Desmond, in addition to econometric approaches from Anne Case, Angus Deaton and David Cutler.

For instance, although the topic of energy transition has been dominated by the physical sciences and economics, sociological insight into the forms of organizational ownership and control, the relationship between the rules of the game and the distribution of winners and losers, and the social meanings that attach to physical structures like oil wells and wind turbines all lead to more effective action on climate change.

How is stigma tied to discrimination, or the unequal access to resources and opportunities? And how might we reduce or challenge stigma? How can we promote its opposite, social recognition?Together, we will unpack the concept of stigma by diving into case studies. We will discuss the stigmas associated with dirty work, polluted relationships, illness, disability, poverty, criminal records, and more. We will also analyze the ways stigma intersects with class, race, gender, and sexuality.

These issues are extensively shifting the ways we live, and, at the very least, are the uninvited corollary through which we might imagine new expressions of the cemetery.As sites of remembrance, cemeteries may be considered as ‘places where memory crystalises and secretes itself as part of an ongoing construction of history’ (Pierre Nora 1989), whilst simultaneously acting as ‘settings in which memory is a real part of everyday experience’ (Michael Rothberg 2010). They are spaces that are socially produced and made productive in social practice (Lefebvre 1974), whilst also being highly logistical practical settings created in the absent presence of the body (Ken Warpole).Just as death is a necessary part of life, cemeteries are sites of contrast, yet it is perhaps through the very preservation of this tension of contradiction that they exist as some of the most enduring landscapes across cultures around the world.Often perceived as a space ‘apart’ from the city as a consequence of their physical traits and phenomenal characteristics, cemeteries none the less play significant roles within the life of the metropolis as biodiversity hotspots offering ecosystem services in the form of thermal regulation, stormwater management, and carbon absorption. They provide significant social functions such as spaces for people to seek sanctuary, reflection and play, and healthy spaces for individuals to contemplate in the context of a natural landscape.Cemeteries, capable and perhaps charged to carry multiple meanings, are paradoxical spaces described by Foucault (1967) as ‘heterotopias’, a no place that, nonetheless, is. The studio will be exploring what the urban and social significance of the cemetery of the future could be, and ask what are the forms and cultural expressions the urban cemetery might project? How might the articulation of the material and physical space reinterpret the temporal experience of the cemetery, and how might the increasingly rich cultural diversity of a progressive society be celebrated through ritual and mediated through disparate processes of burial and internment? How might the cemetery critique and address the extensive environmental and social issues that are before us by proposing alternative organisational patterns and expression, a place that celebrates diverse beliefs and rituals, and a space as an important contribution to the city’s natural systems?",,Graduate School of Design,,,Landscape Architecture,Core Studio,In Person,GSD Graded,,,,

From individual to collective, from spatial to infrastructural,  from units to systems, housing not only confronts the multiple scales of design but also exposes the values and ideals of its society. The semester will be an opportunity to imagine the possible futures of the city, recognizing the role of architecture at the intersection of the many interdependent as well as contradictory forces at play, and the negotiations that must necessarily take place. The semester will be organized in two overlapping phases. The first weeks will be an intense research and analysis phase through which the students will develop not only an understanding of historical precedents but also begin to formulate their narrative on urban living – a hypothesis that they will use to launch their design for the rest of the semester. While this hypothesis will be constantly revisited and revised, it will serve as a first speculative act.The second phase of the semester will be devoted to the elaboration of an urban project with a focus on housing and will have as its objective the understanding of design as a series of relativities: between building and the city, between collective and individual, between civic and domestic. The architectural project is fundamentally optimistic. It goes beyond problem solving to imagining a better future.

Among others: President Biden´s administration realignment with the Paris Agreement followed by his American Jobs Plan[1] and the Roadmap for Nature-Based Solutions[2] at the COP 27; the commitment to swift from fossil fuels at COP 28; Mayor Michelle Wu’s Boston Green New Deal & Just Recovery [3] synthesizing many of the Boston Climate Action [4] initiatives toward climate resilience and decarbonization; or EPA5 and the Mystic River Watershed Association to reduce pollution.

As an academic exercise, we will have the freedom to move beyond the “status quo” of present possibilities, to more desirable outcomes toward climatic resilience in the Near Future.

Urban Economic Policy,SUP  680,Gordon Hanson,2026 Spring,Full Term,,,,,,17471,213565,No Consent,,,False,True,False,True,False,False,False,"This course examines the role of public policy in urban and regional economic development. Cities are the engines of modern economies. They attract workers seeking jobs, firms pursuing access to markets, consumers wanting an abundant variety of goods and services, and families searching for schools and community. Urban density confers economic benefits by making workers more productive while on the job and providing them with greater leisure opportunities while at play. Yet, city residents must contend with traffic congestion, expensive housing, pollution, unequal access to opportunity, and disease exposure. Alongside larger cities, smaller cities and rural communities play vital economic roles, often by leveraging their natural resources. Regional pull-and-push factors, together with competition between regions for capital and labor, create a hierarchy of places, in which there tends to be a small number of large cities, a large number of small cities, and inequality within and between places. Technological change, globalization, climate change, and government policy continually perturb economic geography, moving regions up and down the ladder of prosperity. In part one of the course, we examine the economic forces that drive urban and regional growth, induce industries to concentrate geographically, and cause some communities to flourish and others to languish. In part two of the course, we consider policies to address affordable housing, urban sprawl, traffic congestion, regional economic disparities, climate change, informal settlements, and the rise of work from home. The course emphasizes data analytic approaches to urban economic policy and involves a mix of traditional lectures, and in-class case studies and policy debates. About 60% of course material relates to the U.S. and about 40% of material is international.

Students develop a movement skillset different from that of the actor or dancer, specific to the puppeteer. While training students’ bodies, the course expands their minds’ ability to recognize the potential for liveness in all things and generate story without words. We work with simple objects, solo tabletop puppets, giant ensemble puppets, and bunraku-style dolls.Similar in format to a dance class, students begin each day with movement exercises training specific puppeteer skills: manipulating energy inside and outside the body; harnessing momentum and suspension; moving body appendages separately from one another; and performing ‘invisibly.’ Exercises lead into improvisations. Students learn to devise original dramatic material with patterns and movement dynamics in every class. We begin with non-anthropomorphic, simple objects like spheres and sticks, followed by materials that can spontaneously transform into creatures, like newspaper. At midterm, students each devise a solo scene with a tabletop puppet, figurative or otherwise. The foundation movement skills provide a common vocabulary for giving and receiving feedback. This trains students’ eyes for analysis and offers a path forward for revising their performances.The second half of the course focuses on multi-operator puppets where leading and creative following is key. Students learn to perform in a group, attend to all action onstage, and, in improvisation, react with the best choice for the whole. With bunraku-style puppets, we study how to convey a sense of gravity, the mechanics of puppet walking and running, puppeteer choreography, and what makes a puppet appear to think and feel. Movement work is supplemented with short readings that engender a conversation on the nature of puppets. What is or isn’t a puppet and why? Who is the puppeteer within a scene? How can this unique relationship dynamically change to support the storytelling? How does the inanimate nature of a puppet inspire choreography as well as thematic content? What is a puppet stage and how is it central to story and liveness?The final project is a group scene performed for a live audience during reading week. Homework includes practice videos, rehearsals, short readings, viewings, and journal entries.","Visit the Canvas course page for enrollment information and deadlines.

You’ll learn how archives shape cultural memory, how exhibitions tell stories, and how performance itself could be curated. Field trips to off-campus galleries and museums will provide experiential context, further blurring the lines between classroom work and the real-world. By hands-on, we mean it! You will use your hands to make small-scale, mock exhibits utilizing physical materials as well as an array of fun, new tools we’ll explore at the Bok Learning Lab and the Reef Makerspace. Additionally, we’ll have guest visitors and working artists joining periodically to provoke you critically in new directions. Regular feedback from peers and professionals will help to deepen and sharpen your nascent exhibits towards final revisions. This is an advanced, interdisciplinary course suited for folks interested in visual storytelling, lost histories, performance studies, or applied theater. You will work both individually and collectively as archivist-builder-scholar-storyteller excavating towards a singular event. The semester culminates in a public showing of our collective curatorial experiments—a staged rehearsal, so to speak, of what a “museum of theaters” could look like. Along the way, students will gain hands-on experience in archival research, curatorial storytelling, and exhibition design, while building invaluable skills in critical history, creative intervening, collaboration, and unconventional invention.","This is an advanced, interdisciplinary course suited for folks interested in visual storytelling, lost histories, performance studies, or applied theater.",Faculty of Arts & Sciences,,,"Theater, Dance & Media",Studio,,FAS Letter Graded,,N/A,N/A,N/A
Koteba: Bamana Performative Traditions,TDM  148P,Jeffrey Page,2026 Spring,Full Term,,,,,,12435,217582,Instructor,,,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,"The origin of blues music—and therefore gospel, jazz, and hip-hop—has been traced directly to Mali, West Africa. Within Malian ideology, dance is a culture and there is no separation between dance and theatrical practice. Koteba is a masquerade performance tradition that utilizes the theatrical elements of satire to comment on and confront civic injustices within the Bamana ethnic society. Koteba is a word that means “big snail” in the Bamana language, and like the snail, it carries the ideologies and cosmologies of the Bamana people on its back. There are nearly 20 rhythm and movement stylings situated within Koteba. In a multiday festival, these dances are traditionally performed in succession, and often executed with the dancers forming concentric circles, which gives this theater tradition its snail-like name. Traces of this masquerade tradition can be found throughout the Caribbean and the United States in the form of Carnival and Mardi Gras.This class will focus on unpacking four of the dance and rhythm stylings over the course of 12 weeks: (1) Forokotoba, (2) Tansole, and (3) Bara/Baradong. The traditions of Noh drama, Sanskrit theater, and Greek tragedy have informed the development of American dance and theatrical forms, and similarly, a deep investigation of Koteba masquerade performance traditions will offer students of theater and dance informative tools as theorists, practitioners and historians.","Visit the Canvas course page for enrollment information and deadlines.

Digital Media: Environmental Geometries,VIS 2233,Carl D'Apolito-Dworkin,2026 Spring,Full Term,,,,,,19541,225653,No Consent,,,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,"Environmental Geometries investigates techniques for visualizing and designing interactively with hard-to-see environmental forces. This iteration of the class focuses on the geometry of air movement.Air moves like an invisible ocean around and within buildings in response to differences in pressure. This motion can be described mathematically, but solving these equations in each situation remains a challenging and evolving problem. Ultimately, depicting and understanding a complex phenomenon requires more than one model and more than one mode of inquiry, as well as awareness of each specific model’s limitations.There must be a space of interactive architectural experimentation with environmental forces, between general principles, like hot air rises, on the one hand, and computational fluid dynamics on the other, accurate enough to allow realistic feedback, but fast and loose enough for iterative conceptual study. This course tries to create such a space between design-play and engineering through empirical study.This class proposes a back-and-forth process between physical and digital simulations. We will build two physical simulators: a wind tunnel for the simulation of wind-driven ventilation and a salt-water tank for the simulation of buoyancy driven ventilation. We will pair these with two digital simulations: a smoke simulation in Houdini and a fluid simulation developed within the course in C# in Rhino’s grasshopper environment. Students will experience the friction between the digital and the physical modes and engage with both as flexible approximations of reality. This exploration will be expanded with three additional topics: discussion of the heuristic principles of air movement, the mathematics of air models, and historical examples of design before air conditioning.Architects are familiar with material experimentation with visible materials. Students don’t need to become carpenters or masons, but they do need methods to explore, experiment, test and fail, with wood or stone, in order to use them creatively in their designs. By analogy, students need methods of experimenting with the invisible material of air, if they are to gain familiarity with its behavior and consider it in their future work.Alongside the construction of the simulators, students will design a series of models for each simulation and run parallel tests in the computational and physical simulators.

Landscape Representation II,VIS 2142,"Craig Douglas, Min Yeo",2026 Spring,Full Term,,,,,,19477,200804,No Consent,,,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,"The Landscape Representation II course will examine the relationship between terrain and the dynamic landscape it supports and engenders.The course explores and challenges the representational conventions of land-forming and supports a landscape architecture design process that posits the landscape as a relational assemblage of dynamic physical and temporal forces. It investigates the making of landforms through its inherent material performance in relation to ecological processes that describe its connectivity to the ordering and making of the landscape which is a reciprocation of forces between itself and its context at specific scales.Measures of time will be utilized to describe and design the landscape through a comparison of sequence and event, and their intervals, rates, and duration in relation to spatial forces and flows. Time infuses the material reality of the landscape through states of formation: from those that signify stability, through sequences that are predictable and observable processes of change, to those that are uncertain and instantaneous.Representation is approached as an activity of thinking and making in which knowledge is generated through the work. This facilitates an iterative process of reflection in action, enabling testing in which new knowledge informs subsequent design decisions. The course will introduce methods of associative and generative modelling, and quantitative and qualitative analysis visualized through multiple forms of media. These are decision-making models conceived to imbue interaction between evidence-based variables and design input.Lectures and lab exercises will provide the foundation for exploration and discussion and exposure to a set of digital techniques for analysing and generating landform processes to advance technical and conceptual ability, as well as to provide a point of departure for an in-depth awareness of landscape precedents and representational techniques.It aims to provide students with an understanding of landscape as a set of complex systems in which duration and matter are encoded within, and driven by, a changing landscape. The course engages in the advanced exploration of digital media, with an emphasis on responsive and performative modelling as well as the fluid transition between documentation and speculation, 2d and 3d, static and dynamic, and digital and analogue media.",,Graduate School of Design,,,Landscape Architecture,Lecture,In Person,GSD Graded,,,,
Forests and Fields: A Collective Guide to Scaling Agroforestry,VIS 2477,Amy Whitesides,2026 Spring,Full Term,,,,,,19546,225712,No Consent,,,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,"Agroforestry is the intentional integration of agriculture and forestry into a productive system with economic, social, and ecological benefits. The multi-layered interactions between people, plants, animals, and fungi embedded in these practices enhance or preserve the fertility of the land and create hyper-local and regional reciprocities that support complex social systems. While the roots of agroforestry can be traced to tropical food production systems and Indigenous land stewardship practices worldwide, it has more recently emerged as a practice with significant potential to contribute to efforts to the adaptation of temperate food systems and mitigation of increasing environmental and climate-based risks.This course will explore the potential for scaling agroforestry practices in the US by examining the relationships built through the cultivation of North American tree crops, from species-level interactions to regional distribution systems. Significant species and their immediate understory collaborators will be the starting point for unraveling and describing cultivation and stewardship, related ecological and social communities, craft, and other cultural practices.The medium of study will be the field guide. Traditionally a tool for interpreting nature and identifying organisms in their environment, the field guide is commonly a static, one-way means of field study and knowledge sharing. Might a field guide offer insights for collective study and action? How are field studies shaped and practiced? What forms might allow for ongoing input and collaborative knowledge contribution that informs potential futures? Students will respond to these questions and reimagine the field guide not only as a tool of interpretation but as an instrument of change, collaboration, and design. Drawings, fieldwork, and other crafts undertaken in the course will be informed by studying social and ecological relationships and exploring interactive, collective, and fluid means of knowledge sharing and organizing.The course will unfold in three parts: An exploration of the field guide as a form of knowledge collection and dissemination, research and field studies of tree crop species and their dynamic ecological and social communities, and speculation into the potential for these communities to thrive in a climate-impacted future. The outcome will be a field guide to action, at once a collection and a vision for the potential future of collectivity.",,Graduate School of Design,,,Landscape Architecture,Project-based Seminar,In Person,GSD Graded,,,,
Digital Media: Algorithmic Problems: Grasshopper as Medium,VIS 2234,George Liaropoulos-Legendre,2026 Spring,Full Term,,,,,,19542,225920,No Consent,,,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,"Grasshopper has become the design tech world’s second favorite idiom – after Python anyway. Incidentally, it has also become the design tech world’s answer to ‘broken English’: a seemingly easy, go-to language spoken effectively by billions of people, albeit with scant regard for its intrinsic depth, rigor, or idiosyncrasies.Its relative ease of use and commensurate popularity have only exacerbated this paradox. The more people adopt it, the less it is understood. The course will challenge this paradox and explore Grasshopper’s algorithmic complexity on its own merit.Focusing on this most ubiquitous of media may seem like an odd choice at first. Since nearly everyone uses it in some form, Grasshopper is usually taken for granted. In practice, however, while the low bar of entry and ease with which it delivers basic results have led to its widespread adoption as the lingua franca of design and computation, Grasshopper has become the victim of its own success. As the scripting language of choice in fields as disparate as architecture, thermal analysis, robotics, fashion design, and machine learning, Grasshopper is inevitably framed as the lowly enabler of far loftier endeavors, the lowest common denominator of computational design thinking, the plumbing underneath –best dealt with in technical workshops and evening tutorials.This perception is a misunderstanding as a matter of course. With its stark syntactic differences with most other computer languages (one of which is gradually subsuming) and intricate, multi-layered data structures, Grasshopper is nothing if not a complex environment that demands exclusive attention to deliver its full potential. That is the ambition of the course.The syllabus is based on weekly lectures and applied workshops and is generally geared towards dispensing core technical knowledge suitable for use in core and option studios, as well as in advanced computational courses, such as are currently on offer across the GSD.The schedule is divided into two main sections on either side of the midterm week (March 26, 2024).The first section explores the syntax of geometry, with an emphasis on computational and mathematical instruments such as ranges, domains, parameters, and data structures. This part of the course combines (possibly) familiar Grasshopper strategies with decidedly unfamiliar morphogenetic models based on the instructor’s previous offering (VIS 2227 Writing Form, 2017-24). Topics include parametric 3D modelling, procedural tessellation, image processing, and more.The second half of the course offers a critical introduction to Grasshopper’s essential role as a gateway to complex third-party applications for physical and environmental analysis. Topics will include mechanics/kinematics, environmental performance, and strategies of optimization. This part brings together well-known plugins with the elaborate data structures explored during the first half of the course.",,Graduate School of Design,,,Architecture,Lecture,In Person,GSD Graded,,,,

You may have failed in this one, but what if you had a million new chances in a million different worlds?”This course explores new approaches to interpreting, conceiving, and describing landscapes and architecture, along with the emotions they evoke. While traditional representation methods will remain dominant for some time, they often create a one-way cognitive experience with an “emitter” and a “listener” who barely interact. Game technologies allow for the creation of realistic, dreamlike, utopian, and dystopian universes. It is possible to use, disregard, twist, bend or re-invent the laws of physics, the flow of time, the hazards of weather, the perception of depth, but most importantly, it permits absolute freedom.Just as Rome wasn't built in a day, meaningful connections will develop through studies in representation across art, film, and -not surprisingly- video games. Through exploring, designing, and constructing virtual “altered states,” you'll acquire techniques to mature your ideas from early preparatory work through to deployment. This journey emphasizes imaginative solutions over technical prowess. Think of virtual fabrication as a mental blueprint, where elements must be arranged and framed thoughtfully--unless, of course, you want them to be jarringly noticeable.Some topics we'll cover include:Master planning and researchRepresentation strategiesWorking with AIRealtime 3D/AR/VRWeb3 / Metaverse / MultiverseDeveloping a graphic styleRealism vs. IllustrationExpressing emotions through techniqueManaging expectationsVideo game best practicesCreating assets and textures for game enginesSound designNavigation and interactionBlueprints and codeDealing with stress and pressureThe project:Build a “Fortress of Solitude” - a purely virtual, emotional space for self-reflection, detached from the real world. This space doesn't have to be “pleasant”; while it could be peaceful and contemplative, it might also evoke discomfort, anger, or conflict.The tools:Our primary software tools will be Unreal Engine, an industry-standard real-time 3D engine for game world creation and simulation (easily transferable skills to other engines), and Cinema 4D, chosen for its stable and intuitive workflow. Students may use other 3D packages if preferred.Nevertheless, the most vital tools will be a pencil, a sheet of paper, and your mind.Class structure:Each weekly class will have two parts: one focusing on theory, methods, and critique, and the other on technical skills, where you'll apply what's been studied so far. Occasionally, the structure will vary--routine is not the French way.

Drawing Space / Marking Sensation,VIS 2473,Karen Schiff,2026 Spring,Full Term,,,,,,19545,225648,No Consent,,,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,"Designers often draw space digitally, and virtual reality creates vivid illusions of spatial experience. In an age of AI, this course uses freehand drawing to reconnect with the direct, here-and-now, bodily sensations that structure and inform these digital “spaces.” We’ll strive for wordless experiences of space – architectural historian and theorist Zeynep Çelik Alexander calls this “kinaesthetic knowing” and notes that it has long been an undercurrent in design education and practice. Visually articulating such spatial sensations can enrich any mode of creativity.Various drawing experiments – no experience required! – cultivate different ways to see, feel, and represent spatial dynamics. Subjects include interior spaces, intervals between objects, air itself, the volumes in bodies; we'll add spatial adaptations to traditional drawing techniques (such as blind contour and line-free tonal studies), to expand our habits of looking. Arrive willing to play messy -- to get your hands dirty with charcoal, while prioritizing process over product. Visits to campus sites, and to study selected works at the Harvard University Art Museum, enrich our visual vocabulary. Homework and sketchbook drawings expand on class exercises; optional readings in fiction, criticism, and philosophy contextualize the drawing practices. By midterm, students propose a final drawing project to investigate some aspect of spatial dynamics; this project can build on work in another course, expand on a theme from the sketchbook, or relate to a personal curiosity.

By putting the human experience at the center and forefront, from the immediate body scale to the larger environment, encompassing buildings and the urban spaces, the course examines new and emerging models and technologies for the design of innovative architectural human interfaces and technologically augmented physical environments.     The class addresses fundamental questions including: What are new and emergent ways of understanding the digital and physical environments? How can we create responsive and interactive experiences that augment the person’s experience of the physical space? What are the consequences of creating technologically augmented environments? What are the psychological, social, and environmental implications of creating such hybrids? And what are the criteria to measure successful responsive environments?  These questions of analyzing, understanding and designing responsive environments will be tackled through both class discussions and also hands-on designing and prototyping of interactive, responsive installations. Readings and discussions will explore current and historical examples, theories of phenomenology, psychogeography, multisensory experience of architecture, body-centricity, proxemics, interaction design, installation design, and human-machine interface. Informed by this discourse, the first part of the course will engage students in measuring and quantifying the ephemeral and invisible qualities of space and human experience of space. This will form the foundation for students to design spatial and interactive interventions at various scales, ranging from wearables, interactive objects, to large-scale architectural installations. In the process, students will become familiarized with technologies that can change and augment our physical environment such as biometric sensors, electronics, processing, projections, and others.The course will culminate with an exhibition of the students’ responsive and interactive installations of varied scales using the tools and methods discussed in class. The course will take advantage of the resources and the ongoing research at the Responsive Environments and Artifacts Lab.No specific prerequisites are needed.

Digital Media: The Projective Precast,VIS 2232,Nancy Nichols,2026 Spring,Full Term,,,,,,19657,225652,No Consent,,,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,"Whether precast or poured-in-place, nearly every concrete structure takes shape with the help of a sacrificial structure: its mold or formwork. Techniques for constructing molds and formworks have evolved countless times over centuries yet remain a ripe territory for reinvention. Waste-reduction, ease-of-use, and reusability affect both construction costs and sustainability. Our ability to distribute material where it needs to be - and to limit waste where it doesn’t - has the potential for even larger impact. As sustainability concerns and new material technologies drive concrete into ever-more-nimble, ever-more-slender forms, an opposing desire haunts our discipline: a nostalgic yearning for stereotomic thickness. Poché, divorced from its pure structural necessity to historic masonry structures, persists under new alibis in contemporary design. Similarly, the graphic techniques of stereotomy—that is, traditionally, of describing cut stone—find application across a range of computational and geometric applications.In this course, we will attempt to reclaim a stereotomic understanding of surface development towards the production of low-waste, inexpensive and reusable, sheet-derived mold forms. In contrast to many digitally enabled mold-making processes, we will not work subtractively (i.e. we will not use CNC or other routing techniques to carve a negative from a preexisting volume). Instead, we will apply sheet bending and joining techniques to construct a new kind of mold. Casting into these sheet-derived molds, students will test tectonic, structural, and material variables affecting the form and performance of cast architectural elements.Students can expect to spend the first half of the course constructing tabletop-scale molds and testing the pouring process through a sequence of tutorial-guided weekly assignments. Leveraging lessons learned from the collective body of research developed in the first half, students will move on to independent or small-group development of a tectonic concept using assembled cast parts.",,Graduate School of Design,,,Architecture,Project-based Seminar,In Person,GSD Graded,,,,

Intangible Design: Organizations,VIS 2478,Martin Bechthold,2026 Spring,Full Term,,,,,,20903,227739,No Consent,,,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,"Organizations are everywhere, yet their underlying rules and cultures are largely invisible, often complex, and inherently difficult to understand let alone change. This new exploratory course teaches methods to analyze and characterize organizations in the context of specific challenges, with the goal of ultimately strategizing for change.We are all exposed to multiple organizations, involuntarily or by choice, including but not limited to governmental, educational, religious or corporate organizations, as well as many others. Many organizations are nested within others, with lines blurred and bi-directional forces enacting impact. Burton and Obel defined an organization as “…a social unit of people with a relatively identifiable boundary that is structured and managed to meet a collective goal.” (Burton and Obel, 1984). Organizations are systems with cultures, and their governing forces are mostly intangible.The core hypothesis of the course is that design as a discipline, with its unique methods, outcomes and cultures, can be leveraged to describe, visualize, understand and ultimately transform complex organizations. To understand this claim more in-depth we will venture on a journey that at times will resemble a studio (albeit without the space and with much lower intensity), at other times will feature workshops and discussions, lectures, or site visits. The course will be a real time experiment, because our ambition will be to leverage a set of methods borrowed from the design disciplines in a context that they were not conceived for. This ‘methodological hacking’ will touch upon a variety of tangentially important fields including systems theory, organizational theory, and psychology. These fields will be approached through readings, lectures and guest presentations, always through the lens of design. While theoretical foundations will be emphasized throughout the term this is ultimately a project-based class, which is how the various divergent strands weave together into strategic visualizations of the intangible.There are numerous potential projects that would be suitable to build related analytical and visualization skills. Given this particular moment in time, our project this year will be Harvard University itself, a highly complex, decentralized organization with unique organizational characteristics at a scale that makes change particularly difficult. Harvard as a procedural and cultural system is being challenged through a range of societal developments, including the rapidly shifting disciplinary fields it seeks to contribute to. While Harvard is our ‘project site’ the learning outcomes are not dependent on it, as the ‘site’ is interchangeable. Students will learn generalizable approaches and methods suitable to analyzing and characterizing organizations through visual means, to model and visualize these systems, and for advancing theories of change.There are no prerequisites for the class.

Plant Remains: Representing Disturbance through Digital Media,VIS 2479,Sonia Ralston,2026 Spring,Full Term,,,,,,20905,227740,No Consent,,,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,"Plants die. But how often do we see dead plants in digital landscape representation? In the corners of renders and animations, vegetation from digital asset libraries—collections built into tools like V-Ray, Enscape, or Lumion—is typically rendered in a lush climax state. These 3D models operate as an aesthetic shorthand for lush, green, and idealized nature, sanitizing digital landscapes that are modeling futures shaped by collapse and scarcity. What is often missing, however, is the visual language of disturbance that is made legible through the remains of plants and the plants that remain. These absences raise a critical question: what does it mean to design or depict a landscape without death, and what stories are lost when we do? Death in the landscape is not incidental; it is informational. Dead and dying plants index a wide range of causes for landscape change—drought, disease, pollution, invasive species, shifting climates, extraction, or neglect—each embedded in specific sociopolitical and ecological histories. Within scientific collections like herbaria and arboreta, plant remains are collected, catalogued, and preserved for their evidentiary value—though these material archives are also faced with their own forms of loss and disturbance. Botanical collections, living and dead, understand plant remains not as disappearance, but as data that traces of the past and indicates the future.In this course, we will disturb the digital plant collection. By developing landscape assets that depict mortality and decomposition, we will respond to the technical and conceptual gaps in visualization software that flatten ecological relationships with time, history, and disturbance. By including the remains and plants that remain in our screens—the burnt tree, the felled forest, the withered crop—we will aim to demonstrate complexity, context, and consequence into plant representation by considering their physiological responses to stressors. Using open source 3D scanning and animation software, students will develop representations of plants based on herbarium reference material and live plant specimen to create drawings, 2D and 3D animations. Focusing on plants sited in the northeast, these representations will describe how plants change over the course of their lifecycles and how they respond physiologically to environmental change and stressors, culminating into a final project in a digital medium of the students’ choosing. Course material will be supported by reading on environmental history and theories, lectures, and field trips to local collections, living and dead.Students are encouraged to experiment: no prior experience with digital animation software is required, just a curiosity and interest in learning more.",,Graduate School of Design,,,Landscape Architecture,Project-based Seminar,In Person,GSD Graded,,,,

In zeros and ones, in what we call the cloud. A space that appears limitless, yet whose possibilities are predetermined long before we trace a line or move a cursor, by the tools that structure it and those who own them.Like language, which defines the boundaries of what can be expressed, systems of architectural representation shape not only how we interact with the world but also the limits of our imagination. The way an image is constructed determines the world it brings forth. Over recent decades, programs such as CAD, SketchUp, BIM, and Rhino have automated processes of representation, establishing conventions that condition how we design, what we design, and how we build. These tools and their encoded logics have generated distinct aesthetics and architectures. The rise of artificial intelligence (AI) and the increasing accessibility of computational power introduce new paradigms.AI-assisted drawing is increasingly commonplace in classrooms and offices, opening new spatial conceptions. Yet as it reshapes architectural practice, it also exposes the material and political infrastructures that sustain it. Far from neutral, its outputs embed ideology while binding architecture to planetary processes of extraction that lie at the center of contemporary environmental disputes.The repercussions of the digital on the analog are palpable in the heat of machines rendering images that dominate architectural production. Behind individual devices lie vast infrastructures of servers consuming electricity, cables spanning oceans, and mines cutting into mountains to extract the minerals essential for digital operations. Each prompt activates data centers that demand immense amounts of energy and, often, potable water for cooling. Maintaining these images (along with their duplicates and backups) keeps servers running and resources flowing.This seminar combines architectural research with media studies, environmental humanities, and political ecology to examine the “depths” of the cloud: its material foundations and entangled geographies. We will study the architectures of digital infrastructures that underpin both everyday life and architectural practice. We will ask how architecture might engage in their redesign. Drawing on examples such as sovereign and Indigenous clouds, feminist servers, permacomputing imaginaries, and low-tech or feral computation, we will reconsider the relationship between architectural drawing and resolution. Together we will explore aesthetics of incompleteness, low-carbon computation, and community-driven data infrastructures. We will challenge the paradigm of speed and constant connectivity and imagine new rhythms for the digital world—ones that embrace pauses and attunement with the climate.Through readings, discussions, and case studies (including the tools we use daily) the seminar seeks alternatives to dominant models of the digital space, proposing affirmative ways of inhabiting and operating in the world, digitally and otherwise.",,Graduate School of Design,,,Graduate School of Design,Project-based Seminar,In Person,GSD Graded,,,,

What unique challenges do trans and gender-diverse youth face in seeking medical care as a result of recent transphobic laws and policies? How are community organizers advocating for the end of medical neglect, abuse, and torture in prisons and migrant detention facilities? In this largely discussion-based course we explore these questions and many others. Social approaches to medicine and public health challenge and expand contemporary debates in the medical humanities by centering issues of gender, race, and sexuality. This course provides an overview of the theoretical landscape and social movements that ground recent developments in the field. In particular, the course engages feminist theory, disability justice movements, critical race theory, queer theory, anti-colonial thought, and trans liberation movements. Special attention is paid to the structuring force of anti-Blackness in various clinical and research settings, the development and racialization of transgender medicine, and what it means to view state violence as an issue in public health and the medical humanities.",,Faculty of Arts & Sciences,,,"Women, Gender & Sexuality",Seminar,,FAS Letter Graded,,N/A,N/A,N/A
