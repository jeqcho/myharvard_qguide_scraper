You&#x27;ll learn a lot of stuff for sure.<br/><br/>The essence of the course is in the textbook and in the homework, the lectures and sections only add to that in case you want to be more guided. There are a lot of resources: practice finals, review sessions, mockup exam pizza parties, and all kinds of stuff (yeah, most of them are exam&ndash;related). But again, just read the textbook over and over again and do homework &ndash; that&#x27;s it.<br/><br/>I would say the course has 3 stages:<br/>&ndash; The counting and combinatorics part. I enjoyed that a lot, but I think some background is helpful.<br/>&ndash; The more calculus&ndash;heavy part: lots of integrals and derivatives. Some people found this easier but it can get messy at times.<br/>&ndash; The theory part. You have to know the properties of all distributions and how they all connect, so this part is all putting in the time and actually &gt;&gt;reading the textbook&lt;&lt;.<br/><br/>In conclusion, this course achieves a lot in just one semester. Although it is not perfect, it somehow teaches a lot about statistics in a relatively friendly way.</td>

You not only learn a great deal about prob&#x2F;stats but develop intuition re: pattern&ndash;matching, problem solving etc. Technically, the only prereq is Calc, but having linear algebra &#x2F; multi background can help you (albeit a very small portion of the time) understand better. Psets took about 10 hours on average, lots of OH to help. Midterm and Final are very fair in terms of difficulty and there are many resources. My advice: read the textbook and watch the lectures.</td>

Joe is a sweetheart and the problems are SUPER fun (and yes, they are challenging). I would say that the knowledge from this class is super applicable to basically any discipline, but I took it for its relevance to the life sciences. I don&#x27;t regret it. I grew so much, but taking this class with mcb112 was THE MOVE. I understood way more of both classes by seeing probability principles being applied to actual biological contexts which was super fun. Definitely recommend that combo.<br/><br/>Take all practice exams for the midterm and final, and you&#x27;ll do fine. Start psets early because you will struggle with some of the problems and struggling with them consistently throughout the semester is part of the process and will leave you in a much better position for the exams.</td>

Yes, it will suck your life away for the semester. But I will say this course will teach you a lot about balancing a workload as well as working with the teaching team. <br/><br/>Don&#x27;t even try to do the problem sets yourself the first few weeks. Go to office hours. You will need it to at least get a sense of the structure of the course. Also, read the textbook (it helps a lot in explaining concepts). The teaching team is hand picked by Joe every year and are always amazing. Joe himself will answer your questions day and night on Ed as well; USE THESE RESOURCES! It will help you so much.<br/><br/>In the end though, you can and will make it through. The curve helps a lot. And everyone is struggling right along with you. YOU GOT THIS!!</td>

However, it was WAY too focused on proving properties of distributions (ie why normal distribution&#x27;s expected value is what it is) when homework and final much more rarely discussed it. Wish focused more at without mixing in proofs while we are learning the distribution itself. It made it incredibly hard for me to master the material regardless of what resource provided from the class I used. With that being said, Joe is phenomenal and the class is incredibly staffed. Highly reccomend using this alternate textbook WITHOUT too many proofs and step by step explanations of the math that someone wrote as their thesis after taking 110 to learn (which i only found during final prep): https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bookdown.org&#x2F;probability&#x2F;beta&#x2F;</td>

In the first half of this course, you&#x27;ll find it fairly easy. There will be new concepts but I personally never went to lectures and only read the textbook, and that was enough to get me a solid grade (90+) on the midterm after grinding VERY hard the week before. After the midterm, especially if you did well, you&#x27;ll want to continue putting in minimal amounts of work in this class so you can dedicate more time to ECON 1011A, which also happens to really ramp up after around October as the modeling projects start and the lectures just become absolutely incomprehensible. <br/><br/>DON&#x27;T. DO. THIS. <br/><br/>That&#x27;s the mistake I made. I feel like for ECON 1011A, whether you get a 50 (a very good score) or a 40 (an average score) or a 30 (a below average score) really comes down to how hard you grind the week before the exam. It&#x27;s possible to grind out the concepts, and keeping up week to week doesn&#x27;t matter that much because 1. you won&#x27;t be able to keep up and 2. you&#x27;ll forget anyways. That time is SO much better spent on STAT 110. As soon as the midterm ends, the first week back is spent on continuous random variables. Everything from then on rapidly builds on top of each other. <br/><br/>After doing well on the midterm, I probably spent two to three weeks slacking, and by then the material was impossible to keep up with. Working with friends helped me do well on the p&ndash;sets, but I absolutely BOMBED the final. After the midterm you have to try and keep up week to week. Don&#x27;t leave everything to reading period, especially since you also need to study for ECON 1011A. STAT 110 is a course where I think working harder genuinely leads to a better grade. ECON 1011 is not. So spend your time on STAT 110, even if it&#x27;s deceptively easy in the first few weeks. Make sure you do every single practice exam before the final—I&#x27;ve realized so much of this course is genuinely just pattern recognition.</td>

I really enjoyed the content and thought it balanced breadth and depth of material quite nicely to a provide a foundational understanding of probability. However, Joe&#x27;s lecture style did not really click for me and I found it difficult to motivate to attend lectures. Going to section + reading the textbook will teach you the same content. <br/>The PSETs could be unnecessarily hard at times and office hours were often crowded and difficult to get help at (although Jasai was amazing). However, most of your friends will likely be in this class with you, so you always have people to collaborate and check work with. And the exams are definitely easier than the PSETs.<br/>Overall, I learned a lot in this class, but felt that the teaching style and assignments could be slightly non&ndash;conducive to my learning process at times.</td>

I loved every single second of this course. It was extremely difficult, but I decided to dedicate a lot of time to studying and homework in the hope of becoming 0.1% better every day. And I did. Please do this class, Harvard students &ndash;&ndash; don&#x27;t worry about difficulty level, don&#x27;t worry about GPAs, worry first and foremost about making the most of your Harvard experience to do as many difficult classes as you can. No matter what field you go into, there WILL be a statistics component to it that you could explore if you so choose. And that&#x27;s when you will look back on the 3 months you spent in STAT110 thinking deeply about randomness and uncertainty. Thanks to Professor Blitzstein, my amazing section heads (Julia and Hanna), and our OH TF (Calista), I have so much admiration for you.</td>

It is amazingly&ndash;written and was, personally, basically the only resource I used to get through this class. I also talked to some people who found the textbook disorganized or hard to read; in that case, try the section notes, which clump all the theorems and formulas together if that&#x27;s more your style.<br/><br/>Joe is a pretty bad lecturer, so don&#x27;t feel pressured to go to class or watch the lectures later. The material of the course requires nothing beyond single&ndash;variable calculus, BUT I will say that it seemed like the students with math backgrounds fared significantly better in picking up the material quickly. I never went to section so I can&#x27;t say how helpful that would be, but I would certainly recommend giving it a shot if the material doesn&#x27;t seem to be clicking.<br/><br/>If you are a more mathy type like me, the first few weeks will probably feel like filler, but the material quickly ramps up and becomes much more interesting, especially after the midterm. I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;d *highly* recommend this class to anyone, but I thought it was a decent enough introduction to probability. Very much looking forward to STAT 111 next semester!

I would HIGHLY encourage attending lecture in person (especially on Halloween). I believe Joe is a MUCH better lecturer on x2 speed (he talks slow and rambles :) however it is very hard to find motivation to watch the recordings.

This course is probably a requirement for you so I recommend taking other easy courses alongside it because this must be your priority. Attend lecture attend lecture attend lecture. Do not fall behind. Don&#x27;t bother trying to complete psets yourself (chat gpt is amazing at them and will save your life), focus on exam questions.

The thing that will help you survive (because the PSETs are very long) is having a PSET group and figuring out which office hours to go to since it really depends on the TF.  The tests and midterms are also very hard but it&#x27;s on par with the past&#x2F;practice one they upload. The TFs say the more practice tests you do the easier you are to see the patterns and recognize that certain questions are just another one in disguise lol.  However, not everyone has time to do all the practice tests (like me) so just do your best. As for Joe he&#x27;s not a very good teacher but that&#x27;s to be expected from the STEM department here, but the textbook is honestly very helpful especially in completing psets.  He is also dismissive of accommodations approved by the DAO and unwilling to honor or assist students with them. He believes class policy should be enough for everybody regardless of any disability you have. Hopefully, someone talks him and this changes but that&#x27;s something to keep in mind, especially if you don&#x27;t need to take the course.  <br/><br/>Oh and if you&#x27;re taking this with CS61 please please make sure everything else on your schedule is as light as feather.</td>

You can learn a ton and do very well regardless of whether you are studying CS or applied math or classics—just ask for help when you need it (there are TFs everywhere and office hours happening all the time, and you can go to any section you want each week) and don’t fall too far behind (though I knew people who were multiple weeks behind at some point and were still able to catch up). <br/><br/>Class content&#x2F;what you’ll be doing: The class largely focuses on learning various distributions—such as the normal, exponential, binomial, hypergeometric, poisson distributions—and how to interpret&#x2F;use them in stories and math. You’ll learn the story of a distribution and also the math functions associated with it. For example, a random variable X that represents the number of times a fair coin lands head in 5 tosses is distributed by the binomial distribution—and you’ll use this fact in lots of creative ways to understand how to find out lots of things about that X. You might need to find its mean, or its variance, or you might not know the distribution of X at all but you can still describe it with the story of the distributions, or find other parameters of the variable. <br/><br/>Importantly, the first two weeks are rather distinct from the rest of the semester (counting is important to understand, but it’s very different from the other things you’ll actually be doing, even if they’re technically built on counting). Some say the first two weeks are the hardest, some say they’re the easiest—I think counting is just a different idea from the probability stuff you do later which is more about creativity in math and problem solving.<br/><br/>Tips: <br/>1) Skim some of the problems in the chapter of the textbook that your homework is on. The book, generally, is really really good (and actually is relatively fast to read and understand, all things considered).<br/>2) Go to office hours, especially in the first few weeks, and work on the homework with other students and a TF around—strategize how you’ll tackle problems and then just do it.<br/>3) Have faith in yourself! Nothing is unlearnable, every problem can be solved, and almost half of all problems (especially in the second half) have quick solutions where you might not have to integrate a big ugly thing—you can just use tricks based on knowing probability rules. (You’ll solve math problems but because they’re about probability&ndash;related variables, all the probability&ndash;related properties of those variables can help you solve it.) When you think a problem is hard, know that it’s not impossible and you can solve it—when you’re in the second half of the class and you look back at an earlier question that stumped you in week 2 or 3, you’ll think it’s relatively easy.<br/>4) Take the practice tests, as many as you can. do NOT need to take all of them since you wont really have time, just take as many as you can and it’ll help–by far the best way to spend study time.<br/><br/>I tend to be dissuaded when I read reports that say a class is a horrible, stressful experience that will painfully forge you into being more able to problem solve—and I don’t think that fits this class. I think it’s a difficult class, but likely manageable if you find what works for you, and you will certainly learn a lot and probably see the world differently and have better confidence in your creative problem solving! <br/><br/>Professor Blitzstein is a great teacher too and the TFs&#x2F;sections are all super helpful.  <br/><br/>Having said all this, there are many reasons not to take this class—if you have major extracurricular obligations or other classes you might be nervous about or just really don’t like the subject material (and don’t need it for a major) then it doesn’t make much sense to put yourself through it. Also, if you try it out for a couple weeks and hate it, then dropping it might totally make sense before you’re stuck with it.<br/><br/>Best of luck!</td>

It is incredibly time&ndash;consuming, difficult, and stressful. That being said, you also do learn so much. I really wish I could redo this course again if I could, but since I can&#x27;t, I&#x27;ll detail my advice to y&#x27;all here: <br/><br/>1) DO NOT RELY ON OFFICE HOURS &ndash; you&#x27;ll hear a lot of people telling you to visit office hours. And yes, office hours are an amazing resource for the class. I went to at least 4&ndash;6 office hours a week, and would spend hours there working on my problem sets, talking with other kids in the class, and struggling through the problem sets together. I, myself, relied heavily on office hours as time where I was able to speak with TFs about the problem solving process and get some guidance as to how I should approach the problems. But that was ultimately the problem. When it came to performing on the midterm and the final, I lacked the CRUCIAL ability to start problems on my own. I got used to spending maybe 10 minutes reading a problem on the pset, thinking about ways to solve it, attempt it, get stuck, and then ask a TF where I went wrong. And there&#x27;s nothing wrong with that strategy for completing the psets. I would argue that I still learned a lot from this method. However, it rendered me unable to start the problem&ndash;solving process on my own, which is NECESSARY to perform on exams. I got used to having someone there who would point out a theorem I should review, or a strategy I could perhaps start with, and that little nugget of information would allow me to solve the problem. And don&#x27;t get me wrong, I did the rest of the problems on my own. Yet, that starting piece of how to tackle a problem is what you need most on the exams, and I wasn&#x27;t able to perform because I didn&#x27;t train that part of my thinking and instead relied on office hours. <br/><br/>2) READ THE TEXTBOOK &ndash; you&#x27;ll also see this in a plethora of comments, but you honestly HAVE to do this. I personally was not the type of person who was able to process things in lecture. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I still attended all of them and took notes, but more often then not, I spent that time trying to decipher Joe&#x27;s handwriting so I could copy his work down, and the other half I would semi&ndash;process the material but still be confused and he would move on so fast that I couldn&#x27;t address a fundamental misconception I may have had about the topic at hand. I sincerely hope that&#x27;s not the case for you. But if it is, you should definitely read the textbook. It is very clear and good at explaining materials that I really wish I had carved out and dedicated time each week to reading the textbook. <br/><br/>3) BALANCE YOUR COURSELOAD &ndash; you might be dumb like me and take 5 classes with Stat110. Or you might be ramping up recruiting and punch events too. Or you might be super heavily involved in a lot of other things on campus. Unless you&#x27;re a Math 55 and AIME&#x2F;IMO genius, you should come into the course understanding that Stat110 is going to be so time&ndash;consuming that you&#x27;re going to have to adjust other things and recognize that. <br/><br/>Other than that, I say good luck!</td>

I regret not taking it pass&ndash;fail (although I might have honestly just failed anyways). Lectures are terrible, they do not set you up with any ability to complete the PSETs. None of the resources in this class actually provided me with any chance in growing intuition in solving the problems they asked. At any attempt for a chance to grow intuition and move away from definitions, you are given another definition in the form of a story, yet knowing when to apply them is still impossible. I’m coming out of the class feeling like I actually know less about probability than I did coming in.  I learned about Markov chains in my Linear Algebra class and felt confident about them, and then this class came along and ruined it for me. The one saving grace is the grading scale, of which 45% of your grade comes from homework, and the pre&ndash;curve cutoffs are given to you quite explicitly, so you know what to aim for. Even with this, I am at risk of not passing the class with credit, because the midterm and final are so brutal that it’s almost humiliating when you turn in your half empty booklet because you didn’t even know where to start on most of the problems—and what you did know, you rely on the partial credit to come and save you for the rest of the problem. In fact, it might be humiliating, considering Joe made fun of his own students for getting low scores on the midterm. PSETs took several hours to complete, and office hours rarely helped, especially when you take over an hour to complete just one problem (there are 7 on each). If you think you can skate by just using ChatGPT, you are in for a rude awakening. If you think this is going to be anything like AP Stats, you are also in for a rude awakening. If you are a CS concentrator, just take ES 150 instead. Yes, I understand this is mostly a skill issue on my end, but be forewarned that this could be your fate as well…</td>

Joe is such a caring professor, and he has honed the class into perfection after teaching it for so many years. This is one of those &quot;quintessential&quot; Harvard classes, and for a good reason. All the material and training the class provides is crucial for any STEM classes you&#x27;ll take down the road, and, even if you aren&#x27;t STEM, it teaches you a strong sense of logic and sense that will serve you well in any aspect of life. I would highly, highly encourage taking this class!!</td>

This was an AM Econ requirement for me, and while my grade in the class is certain to be quite low, it has improved the way that I think and deal with complex problem solving. I have improved at writing up PSETs for other classes &ndash; this class requires very clear explanations of the PSETs. <br/><br/>As far as strategy goes, READ the textbook. It is the same material in lecture, if not better! Would recommend skimming the material before lecture, going to lecture, and then close reading the textbook afterward as you do the PSET. Only after trying all the problems, I would suggest knocking the PSET out in office hours, so start early in the week! To do this, I would have personally needed to put 20 hours a week into this class as opposed to the 10 that I did. Do I regret not putting the adequate time into this class, no. I was involved in some other organizations that took up 25 hours per week of my time and I was enjoying those avenues.<br/><br/>There are 2 ways to think about this class:<br/>1. For those looking for an in depth probability class, plan to make this your #1 commitment for the semester and use the strategy I detailed just above<br/>2. For those with a lot of other commitments but need this for a requirement, trust that the grading system will not let you fail, given that you do all of the assignments, go to lecture, study for the exams, etc. Just don&#x27;t expect to pull of the play of the century and do well on the exams if you don&#x27;t put in the work.</td>

Probability is foundational for almost every STEM (and maybe even non STEM) subject and 2. It is necessary for many professional goals like getting internships. After this course, especially the first half, which focuses on discrete probability, I felt much better prepared with my probability knowledge and was able to ace some interviews using it. Coming from a light competition math background, the first half of the class was very digestible, as it had a lot more traditional counting and probability components. The second half handles continuous distributions, though, which at times went over my head (I hate integrals).<br/><br/>So should you take this class? Absolutely. But beware:<br/><br/>1. TF grading is highly subjective. It&#x27;s not as standardized as in smaller classes where 1 TF grades ALL the class for 1 problem, so you and your friends may get wildly different grades for similar answers.<br/><br/>2. Lecture is not enough, but very helpful for building intuition. Read the textbook.<br/><br/>Joe is very entertaining (did a whole lecture during Halloween roleplaying as Batman) albeit sometimes he says things like &quot;*sigh* I&#x27;m not going to go in detail *sigh*&quot; probably because he&#x27;s been teaching this class for 2 decades or so and is tired of explaining things again.</td>

There were often several weeks when I was super confused, but the problems themselves are like riddles and kind of fun to solve. That being said, prepare for a significant burden on your end to learn the material &ndash; the lectures and textbook are often super theoretically&ndash;focused, so psets require several hours spent re&ndash;learning the material or going to office hours to complete. At the same time, Joe and the course staff really do care, although some of the TFs and office hours are much more helpful than others (some, especially in the first few weeks, are too crowded). The exams are difficult, but there are a lot of practice materials given out beforehand, it really just depends how much time you have to dedicate to studying. I would definitely recommend this class as I came out liking stats, but just be prepared to be really confused for most of the semester and to spend a lot of time on the psets.</td>

I would say also start your PSETs early so that you don&#x27;t end up sacrificing your learning due to the time crunch. For Exams, it&#x27;s better to do a large amount of practice problems than to prioritize making flashcards&#x2F;study sheets. Many of the practice problems follow a pattern and if you do enough of them things start to click and become familiar (You just have to push past the initial frustration of getting questions incorrect before you begin to understand).

If you make an effort, you will learn an incredible amount of material in a semester. The problem sets make you actively learn the material while you do them, so you retain quite a lot of what you learn.<br/>&ndash; This is probably the course with the best structure I&#x27;ve ever taken. You always know exactly what to expect. Lectures, problem sets and the incredible textbook all work together seamlessly. Exam preparation is made much less stressful than other similar courses due to clear expectations and more practice exams than you&#x27;ll ever need.<br/>&ndash; Joe is a great lecturer and if you pay attention in lecture, you&#x27;ll be most of the way to understanding the material.<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>&ndash; The workload of this course is not to be understated. Homework for a single week of this class sometime will take 20 hours, averaging 16 for me. You will practically have to dedicate your entire semester to this class. Your life will revolve around the psets for this class. You will lose sleep due to the workload, especially if you are taking more time intensive classes along with this one. <br/><br/>Tips:<br/>&ndash; If you take this course, it&#x27;s probably because it&#x27;s a requirement. Do what you can to learn as much as you can before you start the psets. My strategy was paying close attention in class, reading the book, and then going to section covering the previous week&#x27;s material.<br/>&ndash; Start the psets early. Psets are due Friday. Take my advice and start the next one on Sunday or Monday at the latest, or you&#x27;ll be questioning your choice to ever have enrolled in Harvard. <br/>&ndash; Go to office hours.<br/>&ndash; Prepare religiously for the exam, especially the final.

The problem sets are helpful but time&ndash;consuming because you have to write up your explanations. Regarding midterms and exams, I found that simply doing as much practice as possible was the best way to go &ndash; you are given around 10 practice midterms&#x2F;finals each time, and for me, that meant doing all of them. However, other people found other resources more helpful, but in general, doing as many practice problems through section, the homework, the textbook, and the practice exams is definitely one of the best ways to improve your understanding of the class content.</td>

But boy was I wrong about the relative difficulty. I thought that Ec1011 would be mind&ndash;boggling hard and Stat110 would be a walk in the park but I could not be more wrong. I thought that Stat was a much harder course than Ec1011 for a couple of reasons: (1) Stat has a wide distribution of student abilities so some people get 95 or 100s on the tests, while others get 40s and this means it is much harder to get a good grade as you need to compete relatively against some strong classmates. However in Ec1011, everyone, no matter how much of a math genius they are, does poorly on the test (around a 50 with a tight SD) so if you are just average like me, you won’t suffer under the intelligence of your smarter peers. (2) Ec1011 is just multivariable calculus and taking derivatives which is much more algorithmic (and you have practice in HS), so the math can be messy but it is not extraordinarily difficult. Also the economic logic taught in the course is very self&ndash;intuitive, so you can generally know a sensible answer to the question.  However with Stat, it is much more about logical, creative problem solving akin to competition math problems which was harder for me (and many others) as you’re not taught in high school how to solve math problems creatively and find a neat trick that makes the problem a lot easier. I found that Ec was more manageable as everyone is similarly lost together in lecture and the class, while in Stat everyone is expected to understand the material, so if you take both classes at the same time, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND SPENDING MORE TIME ON STAT. <br/><br/>Lectures I felt were useful sometimes, particularly at the beginning of the semester. However as the weeks roll on, Joe’s lectures get more confusing and harder to follow so I would recommend switching over to reading the book (especially about Markov chains which is much clearer). START PSETS BY SUNDAY AND DO A FEW PROBLEMS EACH DAY. I didn’t follow this approach and wish I did as I would end up starting them on Wednesday or Thursday when they were due Friday afternoon, and would be scrambling in office hours to get the answers or ask my friends for how to solve. TAKE THE TIME TO STRUGGLE WITH THE MATERIAL AS IT WILL BUILD YOUR PROBLEM SOLVING SKILLS THAT ARE INVALUABLE FOR THE TESTS. When it comes time to studying for the tests, I would not go to any of the review sessions as they simply reiterate the basic material you already know (although read over the review packets they upload to Canvas). FINISH ALL THE PRACTICE TESTS. Hands&ndash;down the best way to study. You will barely know how to do a problem by yourself without looking at the solutions on the first test, but by the time you’re done, you should be able to almost all of them right. <br/><br/>Another thing: SPEND TIME SHOPPING FOR A GOOD SECTION AND DON”T JUST SETTLE ON THE FIRST ONE YOU GO TO. Some section leaders are better than others and some focus more on content review than practice problems. You might like your first section like me because it fits well into your schedule, but I highly recommend taking the time to shop for other  sections in the first few weeks that really engage you and do lots of practice problems (which I felt was how you would end up doing well in the course).</td>

It was a tough course, but the support system is tremendous, and Joe makes sure that is the case, with endless TFs, office hours, and sections. You can get help almost any time during the week. However, I would like to make a special shout&ndash;out to Jordan and Alice, whose section and office hours were endlessly helpful to me. Alice is graduating (If she passes 210), but Jordan will be here a while so find him in Quincy sometime and he will help you as long as you tell him the score of the nuggets game, and do not mention Embiid. That is all conditioning on him still being a TF, which I hope he will be. Also find a study group, mine has been very helpful, in 110 and beyond.  I met them through an Ed post the first week, so don’t be afraid to reach out and find people to get through this course with.</td>

Psets take a long time, they&#x27;re only seven questions but I rarely spent under eight hours on one if I wanted to actually understand what was on my paper. The book is a live saver, USE IT. It has everything you need to know and more. Section is arguably more helpful than lecture, the lectures are kind of boring but not bad, section really deepens your understanding of the content though. Final advice is start the psets on tuesday at the latest so you can go get help from office hours if you need it.</td>

			<td class="TabularBody_LeftColumn" headers="comment-2_9a2c5026-c4d7-46ed-a428-e89758e3592a">STAT110 is a great course, but it is not the easiest. A lot of concepts will feel unintuitive at first, and the only way to really understand the content is to do the problem sets and go to sections as much as possible. The textbook does a great job of supplementing learning, but I would be wary of relying solely on the textbook to understand the entirety of the course content. That being said, this class is manageable if you pay attention during lectures and keep up with the work. You can fall behind fairly quickly, so make sure you keep on top of everything. As a freshman taking other rigorous courses, it was definitely easy to fall a little behind, and it became difficult to catch up on missed content.<br/><br/>Check out the course syllabus if you want to look at course content. The content is somewhat challenging, even if you have a pretty strong math background. I would recommend that to maximize your own learning, try to complete the problem sets yourself, and then work with others on problems that you struggled with. Problem sets are pretty reasonable, but can take a while (you will have to look through your notebook and&#x2F;or the textbook to find certain concepts that are applicable to the question, it will take some time). There is an abundance of OH and sections, so take advantage of those if needed.<br/><br/>Exams are difficult but fair. The midterm is weighted very little, I think in anticipation of students not realizing how difficult the content can be, but the final is weighted as nearly half your grade, so make sure you study well for the final.<br/><br/>Joe is a great lecturer, and he has been teaching this course for many years now, so the content is presented in a very concrete and linear fashion, which helps a lot with understanding. Sometimes he doesn&#x27;t match up exactly with the textbook reading in terms of the order of presenting different concepts, but you will learn the same information from either lectures or the textbook. The textbook is absolutely fantastic and super helpful for problem sets, so definitely take advantage of it, but be aware that it is easier to hear and see Joe explain concepts in lecture than just reading about it in the textbook.<br/><br/>Overall, if you are interested in stats as a concentration or a secondary, or just interested in stats in general, consider taking this course. It is pretty theoretical and challenging, and is definitely a time commitment, but you will learn a lot. Good luck!</td>

But this class totally changed my opinion, and I give a lot of credit to the course&#x27;s emphasis on understanding the intuition behind probability and focusing on problem&ndash;solving over performing mathematical computations. The biggest piece of advice I have is to START THE PSET EARLY! It is so much easier if you give yourself time to complete it over the week and makes going to OH for help much more efficient. Second biggest piece of advice is READ THE TEXTBOOK. Will help you understand lecture better and contains lots of tricks and shortcuts that will help you on the pset and exams. There is so much support available in this class, and if you take the time each week to go over the topics, they will begin to click! I came in thinking I couldn&#x27;t possibly learn probability, much less begin to enjoy it, and I&#x27;m leaving with so much more confidence and a real grasp of the material.

Personally, I found reading both the textbook and attending lectures to be helpful. I will note that there are examples within the textbook that are useful for problem sets (and at times, problem set questions will specifically direct you to the textbook). As long as you work on developing intuition from problems independently and practice effective time management, you will learn a lot and do well in the class.</td>

I did best when I would go to office hours after already looking at the PSET and knowing what topics most of my questions included. I think the only people who breeze through this class somewhat are those that have done math competitions before because they are already thinking differently. However, you don&#x27;t have to be one of those to do well. Take advantage of the resources and also that there are almost 800 people in the class so I&#x27;m sure you can find someone to work with or to go to with questions.

The huge class size and fast&ndash;paced material was admittedly overwhelming for me as someone who didn&#x27;t come into Harvard or this class with the strongest math background: but with hard work, I truly think anyone can get through it. Still, I cannot emphasize enough how important it is to not fall behind in this class. Doing the psets yourself &#x2F; going to office hours pays off so much in the long term—unfortunately, I realized this too late. Spend the first couple weeks really finding office hours and sections that work for you—some sections work better for different learning styles than others, and it&#x27;s good to figure out early if you want one that more focused on review, problem solving, etc. Office hours vary extremely in terms of business—find a good one and stick with it! TLDR: it&#x27;s a hard class. but you will get through it :)</td>

This course is HARD and you will probably find yourself at office hours often. Start the homework early!! There are usually 7 problems and there is about a week to complete it so it is possible to spread it out. Make sure you understand rather than just get the right answers. The textbook is useful and while others may say lecture can seem optional when the book covers more thoroughly I think its valuable to attend or at the very least watch the lectures to consolidate information.</td>

I came in without any context or a strong math background, but I thought it is quite possible to do well. However, you also have to be ready to not get an A. I read both the textbook and went to lecture or watched the recordings, and there are often many examples from the textbook that applies to the psets that Joe doesn&#x27;t go over in class. For psets, it&#x27;s important to think about and try all of problems yourself first, but there&#x27;s so many resources and people in the class (there are OH at virtually all times). Don&#x27;t panic if you aren&#x27;t able to do the psets yourself either (I couldn&#x27;t, and I did pretty well in the class). But take the class!</td>

It&#x27;s also probably gonna be my lowest grade, haha. But I did learn a lot, and I&#x27;m glad I took it. I just wish I could go back and change some things (even though I felt like I studied incredibly hard for this course, maybe I should&#x27;ve studied even harder). <br/><br/>I&#x27;ll start with the pros. I learned a lot about probability. I now feel more confident about calculating and interpreting probabilities in real life (this actually happened over Thanksgiving break when I was able to spot a flaw in logic in a probability argument). If you take this course (if you&#x27;re reading this, you probably have to), you&#x27;ll learn a lot.<br/><br/>Now, onto the cons. Despite what I&#x27;ve heard so many times, this is not an &quot;incredible&quot; course. In my opinion, Prof. Blitzstein is not even that effective as a lecturer. He had a tendency to ramble. He also had a way of making you feel bad if you didn&#x27;t fully understand concepts (like saying things were &quot;obvious&quot; or shouting that LOTUS was &quot;free points&quot; even when, in my opinion, it wasn&#x27;t). If, like me, you don&#x27;t learn much from lecture, you can try the textbook, but honestly, it isn&#x27;t much better. The textbook would often be hailed, but I and many of my friends tried reading it, but it wouldn&#x27;t help that much. I feel like a lot of the people who highly praise the material (and this course in general) are already very familiar with this type of math, but for those of us who aren&#x27;t, it&#x27;s frustrating because it feels like we&#x27;re screaming into a void. Finally, the p&ndash;sets and exams are insanely difficult. Oftentimes, it felt like we were being tested on math tricks (like simplifying ugly fractions and relating inequalities to Taylor series) rather than actual probability, which was frustrating. I don&#x27;t know. There were a lot of problems with this class, but I doubt they&#x27;ll get fixed. I&#x27;ve never seen a class vary so greatly in its student population (the final average was like a 63 with a standard deviation of 20). All I can say is, if you&#x27;re taking this, be ready and good luck.</td>

There are office hours 24&#x2F;7, and posting on Ed allows you to get a well&ndash;written, accurate answer, often within minutes. All the course staff are excellent, and many are exceptionally passionate about helping you learn probability.

Look, it’s hard. Expect it to be hard. Maybe expect it to be harder than you even think. This is probably the most difficult course I have ever taken. There are so many concepts that you have to understand and apply, and it doesn’t get easier throughout the semester. The problem sets are an insane amount of work, and office hours (though plentiful) can get very crowded. I was locked in up until about the midterm, and then I fell off (DON&#x27;T DO THIS). I was really just trying to get by, and when it came time for the final, I realized I really should have been more diligent about my STAT110 work the whole semester. That said, try to stay on top of psets and textbook readings (READ THE TEXTBOOK) and go to lecture so you know what’s going on lol. Even though it was so draining, I really enjoyed the challenge and really loved the concepts. In some ways, STAT took over my life, as I started to think of non&ndash;class things in terms of probability (I’m not joking). It’s a super interesting and I think applicable course, and it will surely set a strong foundation for future study or just life knowledge. There are so many resources available, so the real challenge is if you can and will dedicate the time and energy required to succeed (which is a lot). Good luck!</td>

Note that this class will take up the majority of your time but at the end does lay out the foundation for anything related to statistics and probability in the future.

I&#x27;m studying applied math, and for me this has by far been the most challenging course I&#x27;ve taken for the concentration. Some of the pros of the class are that lectures are recorded and you can go back to them, there is a course textbook, there is almost always OH, and you do get exposed to a lot of material. My cons about the class are that it takes a lot of time, your homework grades vary by who grades your homework (even for the same answer), and the course moves WAY too fast. In theory, someone could try really hard and master the concepts, but if things don&#x27;t just click with you, it feels impossible to be able to get that level of understanding because you have other courses and extracurriculars that are also taking up time. My advice would be to work on problem sets with friends, and also find out what works best for your learning in this course.

Courses taken are: {Math 22A, GenEd, Expos 20, Language}, {Math 22B, FYSeminar, Language, CS51}<br/><br/>Semester schedule: Sophomore Fall &ndash; {STAT 110, COMPSCI 1090A, GenEd, COMPSCI 1200}<br/><br/>Hours Breakdown: <br/>Week 1 &ndash; 10 hours<br/>Week 2 &ndash;  9 hours<br/>Week 3 &ndash; 13 hours <br/>Week 4 &ndash; 6 hours (pretty easy pset) <br/>Week 5 &ndash; 9 hours (pivot to another half of the course)<br/>Week 6 &ndash; 12 hours (just a long pset)<br/>Week 7 &ndash; 10 hours<br/>Week 8 &ndash; 13 hours (tough&ndash;ish pset)<br/>Week 9 &ndash; 13 hours (was lowkey lost for this pset)<br/>Week 10 &ndash; 12 hours (was still lost for this pset)<br/>—Thanksgiving Break—<br/>Week 11 &ndash; 5 hours<br/><br/><br/>Grade Issues:<br/>The exams are fair. The mean for the first midterm ws 63.2. I got less than that for the midterm and around an SD above the mean for the final. Joe values improvement, probably even more than consistent good grades.<br/><br/>Best part about the course: <br/>Interesting material and it’s a really well run course. There are around 40 office hour timeslots and section timeslots and the culture among the TF’s is one of the best I’ve seen in a Harvard class. Grading of exams and problem sets is the fastest I’ve seen at Harvard, and Joe has really perfected the craft of teaching STAT 110 after teaching the course for 18 years in a row now.<br/><br/>Worst part about the course: <br/>You need to be a great test taker for this class, because if you mess up the tests you are really screwed, regardless of your understanding of the concepts. The course really ramps up after problem set 5. You start learning very many new things very quickly and it’s easy for the material to run away from you, especially with other midterms hitting<br/><br/>Tips: <br/>Don’t use up extensions too early. Don’t skip the midterm (which some people do and put all their hopes on the final, best case: you do well on the midterm and it reduces the weight of the final, worst case: you do terrible on the midterm, and do good on the final, which Joe really likes). Doing all the problem sets is the easiest way to get ready for the final. Get a pset group to check answers with, or to do psets with.<br/><br/>TLDR: Great course. Take it. All the homies love Joe Blizzy. Do as many practice&#x2F;textbook problems as you can. Pay extra attention to the course after week 6. Go to section. Read the textbook</td>

And after taking it, I would agree that this class lives up to its name. Notoriously difficult and time intensive, it is no small feat to even complete and pass this course. You have to work for it, and there is simply no way to float by and do well. Despite this, as someone with little background in the probability field, I did not quite know what to expect. STAT110 was one of the most difficult courses I have taken by far, but one of the most rewarding as well. Like difficult things in life, you have to work hard to do well in this class, and sometimes, even despite your best efforts, things still do not quite come together. And that is so okay! This is how I felt about this course, during office hours at 10pm, the night before the exam. This class took the most time out of any course I have ever taken. For each problem set, I spent a minimum of 10&ndash;15 hours on it, and still think I could have put more time into it. It truly taught me how to think analytically question any presumptions that I had prior and learn the problem&ndash;solving methods behind them. <br/><br/>One thing that I loved about this class is how organized it is. This class is setup exactly how I would want it to be &ndash; there are endless resources, problems to work on, and TFs that save you on problem sets (shoutout Liz and Jasai, my goats!). You will end up getting out of the class what you put in, and you will have to put in the hours. But, it is so rewarding, and I think it is a necessary challenge. Joe cares so deeply about his students, and even if your grades on exams don&#x27;t necessarily reflect it, he can see how much work you put in. STAT110 is a beast, but a fun one that I think everyone would benefit from. Chat with your friends, don&#x27;t take 4 pset classes while you take it, and go to as many office hours as you can. You got it, and you&#x27;ll love this community.</td>

You have to make sure you actually have the space and time for this class because otherwise you will hate yourself for throwing this into a crazy schedule.

Additionally, it is very applicable for any type of quantitative job. It is pretty demanding in terms of homework and assessments, but the curve is fair.<br/><br/>The structure of the class is very well put together (even better than something like CS50 with a similar amount of students) simply due to the flexibility that the volume of students taking the class provides. No matter what your schedule is like week&ndash;to&ndash;week, you will always have time to attend one of the sections and office hours because they are offered at virtually any time during the week (including weekends). Although the midterm and final are super challenging, there are TONS of resources provided by the course leading up to them in the form of review sessions, practice exams, practice tests, etc. to the point where you have an incredibly good picture of what the assessment will look like.<br/><br/>tldr: tough but rewarding, take this class!</td>

This class is for people who genuinely enjoy math and problem solving at a high level. If you are mediocre at math, do not take this class. Sure, maybe if you really put in the work you could scrape a good grade, but I think that can be said for many classes. Please don&#x27;t take this class out of FOMO from everyone else taking it Sophomore Fall. Taking this class for that reason was my biggest regret this semester because it was such a waste of time. If you&#x27;re interested in a Stat secondary, know that you have to take Stat 111 as well after this, which is EVEN harder than Stat 110. So ask yourself if that&#x27;s what you really want to do. I genuinely believe this class is the cause of the most peoples&#x27; Sophomore slump. Please make your decision wisely.</td>

Assignments and exams are well&ndash;written and overall this course is super intellectually stimulating.<br/><br/>Of course, as you may have heard, it is no easy class, but most of the difficulty lies in the fact that there are many possible solutions to any given problem and probability isn&#x27;t inherently intuitive. To combat this, I recommend going to conceptual OH &ndash; if you can make different probability concepts more intuitive to yourself, you will feel more confident in the course as a whole!</td>

This course is not the worst thing in the world if you have the time to dedicate to it. You should be prepared to dedicate a lot of hours per week to office hours and outside resources and reading the textbook. It is challenging. I spent over 40 hours a week on this class. You get 3 extensions on the PSETs and a drop. There are an insane amount of office hours. There&#x27;s YouTube.  It gets more difficult if you are taking it with another content&ndash;heavy class; if possible, I would not take them simultaneously. If that is not impossible, do not worry!

Regardless of whether or not you are the type of person who really enjoys rigor (if you do, there&#x27;s really no reason not to take this class), the content in this class elevates your problem&ndash;solving skills. It&#x27;s difficult to explain, but I think I left this class as a completely different student. I enrolled in this class because I wanted a very &quot;mathy&quot; introduction to probability my freshman year, as I came in with quite a strong mathematical background in high school and since I intend to major in AM anyways. What I got back was so much more than just probability theorems and calculus. This class was essentially a course in the science of problem&ndash;solving, and the assignments and exams are structured such that you easily see where you can apply the theory you learn in class. Though I felt pretty certain at the start of my semester that I&#x27;d stick with AM&#x2F;Econ, this class has me seriously considering a switch to the Stat concentration. I&#x27;m taking Stat 111 in the Spring and could not be more excited. Prof. Blitzstein is a fantastic lecturer and I highly recommend attending each lecture, though if you choose otherwise just know that the textbook is really well&ndash;written. It does an amazing job of simplifying abstract concepts into stories and examples that are easy to fully comprehend after just a bit of practice. The book is somewhat of a holy grail for this class so make sure to read through it, especially when you get stuck on psets. The exams and psets are certainly difficult, and the midterm was particularly a big wakeup call for me. The content itself can be hard to wrap your head around. That said, the teaching team is spectacular. They truly care about helping you improve and I highly recommend leveraging Office Hours to ask clarifying questions. I feel like all of the teaching assistants are really passionate about Stat 110 and are excited to help you out when you have questions. It makes it easy to stay motivated in this class. It&#x27;s also very apparent that Prof. Blitzstein is a passionate professor and cares about you as an individual. He&#x27;s understanding when you might need an extra extension and takes the time to break down your exams with you. TL;DR Take this course, yes it&#x27;s hard, Professor and TFs are great, reading textbook is key.</td>

Most important advice: at a minimum, try every pset problem (thoroughly) before getting help or going to office hours. I think so many people just immediately go to office hours or get help without rigorously thinking about the problems and then this just hurts them a lot for the exams. You will do yourself a great service if you actually try the problem sets by yourselves (and then if you can’t do a problem you can get help, but the most important thing is to try it first!).</td>

If I had one recommendation, it would be to do every single practice exam prior to both midterm and final.

Even if you&#x27;re struggling throughout the rest of the semester, putting in the time for these practice exams will make the difference.</td>

I believe that going to office hours are a necessity for completing the problem sets, but I would strongly recommend seriously trying to complete them on your own before asking in office hours &ndash;&ndash; just getting the answers without trying them yourself is not going to bode well on the exams. Some people have said that going to class is not necessary, given that everything is present in the textbook. However, I personally found a great deal of benefit from going to class, and thoroughly enjoyed Professor Blitzstein&#x27;s lectures. I will say that the exam style of question feels distinct from the pset style of question, and the only real way to prepare for the midterm and the final is to do the practice exams that he releases. However, since there are so many of them (10 for each exam) it&#x27;s certainly possible to feel prepared.</td>

Focus on the textbook; it is a truly incredible book and exceedingly well written. With that being said, your focus with the book should be on the general concepts and how they tie together, not on understaning every single proof perfectly.
