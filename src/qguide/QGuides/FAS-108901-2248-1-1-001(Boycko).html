I highly recommend getting your own study group or chain of support early in the semester so you can do well on the PSETs and clear up any confusion you may have. I felt like the slides and PSETs combined were helpful in covering the content that you need to know but you have to spend quite a bit of time outside of lecture to really, REALLY get the material. A general understanding is NOT going to cut it. Do every single PSET and make sure you understand all the steps you took to solve each problem (usually the math) because these problems (called the LP of the PSET) are very similar to questions you&#x27;ll see on the exams. The lectures alone are very fast&ndash;paced and can be confusing often, so it is essential that you spend time outside of class to go over the material again. I think it is best to take this course during a semester where you can be sure you can take a decent amount of time each week to digest the material. If not, this class will be a major struggle. Personally, the midterm felt more brutal than the final, so if your midterm does not go as well as you wanted it to, make sure to take it as a chance to grow and adjust how you are studying&#x2F;spending time on this class. I will say this: if you are not an economics concentrator or secondary, there are better economics courses out there for you to take if you want to take an economics class during your time at Harvard.  But if you are an economics concentrator, be very aware of the demands of this class. Put in a lot of time and effort and things will be okay. You&#x27;ve got this!</td>

Grading is generous, and there are opportunities to earn extra points. Psets (LPs) are not overly tedious, I usually would finish them within 2&ndash;3 hours, the MCQ can be tricky, but collaboration helps. Exams are worth a large part of your grade (midterm + final = 70%), so definitely study early. The course covers a lot of content, and I think the best way to study is to review all the past LPs and MCQs that you struggled with the first time around. I would also personally recommend taking the midterm (there is an option to not take it so that your final grade is worth 70% of your grade), but I think doing well on the midterm alleviates a lot of the stress of having to do well on the final.</td>

Boycko&#x27;s not the greatest lecturer and what you get out of section is highly dependent on your section TF; tbh I only went to lectures and section for the extra credit, which is a whole other problem in of itself. Essentially, this was the first semester that they changed the extra credit system to 10 points instead of 5 points, and once final grades were released, it seemed to f everyone up because expectations about how extra credit was going to be counted was SUPER UNCLEAR. Everyone thought they were getting up to 10 points added on a 1&ndash;100 scale, but instead, they changed the scaling to 1&ndash;110 so that even with 10 full points of credit (given that you maxed out the extra credit), it wasn&#x27;t really helpful for your grade. Everyone&#x27;s up in arms about it and the issue is unresolved as of this moment (when I&#x27;m submitting this Q Guide) so BEWARE OF THE UNCLEAR GRADING EXPECTATION, WHICH AGAIN, ENDED UP SCREWING OVER A LOT OF PEOPLE.</td>

I am pretty sure I screwed up on the final. the midterm was not the best either. Study the LPs and MCQs REALLY WELL.

			<td class="TabularBody_LeftColumn" headers="comment-2_2b160884-b4ca-45f4-9951-73a78203caa1">This class is moderately challenging. If you have a good grasp of micro from 10a&#x2F;previous prep, the first few lecture are going to be a repetition of what was done before, so it is not too bad. I also learned a lot more than in 10a, so it is definitely a good class. However, there are some issues to be addressed.<br/>First. I need to find out what it is with the econ department and MCQs. The weekly MCQs were designed to make you fail, and rarely encouraged actual learning. We (almost) never covered the material that the MCQs would then ask in lecture, thus accounting for confusion in every, single, one, (!!!) of the quizzes. The questions were phrased in such a way that the student getting them right was always based on small technicalities, except for the first two MCQs. This is not good for learning – as it takes away from the review of the actual materials (since you’re busy understanding what’s the right answer across four ambiguous worded and very similar responses rather than studying). On the midterm, the MCQs (developed in the same manner) were worth 40 of 110 overall points – 4 points for each MCQ: too much! Realistically, microeconomics will not ever require you to do what they do in these MCQs, and they are just a way for the teaching team to bring the grade distribution down. I will say that the grade accommodations they provide make it really hard for anyone to get less than an A&ndash;, but I still don’t understand their concept of “learning”.<br/>Second. The class tells you you need calculus. You don’t. You need to know partial derivatives at most. This is a pity since the oversimplification of mathematical derivations renders those with more experience in math pretty confused at some calculations (it seems we’re back to the non&ndash;calculus stage).<br/>Third. The class itself needs to change its grading basis, IMO, and not only encourage participation through extra credit. I can skip all lectures, ace the LPs, MCQs, and the final, and get a better grade than someone more engaged with the material and the concepts. Very bad.<br/>Fourth. Advice for Prof. Boycko: please do not just have slides you go over during lecture very broadly. If you want your students to grasp how to do the exercises, you walk over a model with them – you don’t just put it into the slides with no work in between (and mind you this is not what we did in section). And, PLEASE SUPERVISE YOUR TEACHING TEAM. Undergraduate TFs are notoriously more lenient than graduate students, which is expected, but I got points taken off for the smallest mistakes while I saw with my own eyes how undergrad TFs just scroll over the submissions and give the maximum score to everyone without even looking at the problem set. <br/>Overall it is a requirement– so take it because you have to. But if you seek more rigorous treatment of the material, and dislike useless multiple choice questions, stay away from it.</td>

All of the material is readily available in the slides for lecture and section, so as long as you put time into studying the slides and practicing the long problems, you will do well on the exams. TAKE the midterm even though it is optional &ndash; Low stakes way to try out study strategy for the final. I had the final the day after the STAT110 final, not ideal. Ultimately, I crammed for about 10 hours before the final and felt very comfortable that next day. Redoing the long problems from PSETs and memorizing the useful equations is your best friend. As far as lecture goes, make sure to get the attendance credit. Maxim is a great guy, he just reads a lot of the slides &ndash; granted, the tests are based off the slide material as well. Overall, not bad at all for an econ &#x2F; AMecon (which I am) requirement. Felt EC10a with no econ experience was harder than this class.</td>

If you are an Econ concentrator, you have to take either this class or 1011A to graduate. I don&#x27;t know about you but I&#x27;m all for the path of least resistance, so I&#x27;d take 1010A over 1011A any day. Here are my suggestions:<br/><br/>1) Go to lecture and take notes. This may seem obvious, but if you&#x27;re distracted during lecture, the class will leave you behind. Two missed lectures are enough to be lost. <br/>2) Try out different sections in your first week! The teaching styles and approaches of section leaders make a real difference; figure out what works for you and stick with it.<br/>3) GET THE TEXTBOOK AND READ IT BEFORE LECTURE. Or, at the very least, read it before the exams. Lectures are derived from the textbook, as are weekly MCQs. Familiarizing yourself with this will work wonders for your understanding.<br/>4) Understand the Problem Sets. Ec 1010A encourages study group formation, and while this is a great part of the class, it can also be to your detriment. If you are relying on your study group for the weekly LPs and MCQs, exams will be tough. And exams are 70% of your grade :)<br/><br/>Overall, I loved Ec 1010A, and you will too! Have a good attitude about it: you have to take this class anyway, and you&#x27;ll find it far more taxing if you&#x27;re fighting a mental battle about going to class three times a week.</td>

Here is some advice:<br/><br/>&ndash; Go to lecture and section to learn better and get 10 free bonus points for your final grade. No brainer.<br/>&ndash; Use office hours for pset LPs and MCQs. You will be much more efficient and correct than trying to figure out on your own.<br/>&ndash; Take optional midterm.

However, once you get past midterm 1, the LPs are very easy (around 1 hour long). MCQs are definitely challenging, so find a good study group early on. The midterm was very fair, and grading wise everything ends up pretty fair. I would recommend going to section (they normally really help you on the psets).

The best way to learn is to reason through the LPs early in the week, go to section, finish the LPs in office hours, and finish the week with the MCQ. LPs will take 2&ndash;4 hours per week, MCQs take 2.5 hours. The course covers a lot of ground, so try to stay engaged with the content week over week so it doesn&#x27;t all pile up at the end.

(some things just don&#x27;t make sense&#x2F;there&#x27;s no apparent logic behind them because their proofs are beyond the contents of the course and too difficult for us, but if you ask me those things should just not be included at all or should be included in a very small manner).</td>

The MCQs (especially) and LPs are quite difficult, but they map really well onto the midterm and final. For studying for the exams, the bulk of what I did was just reviewing the MCQs and LPs, as they are very useful. In some ways, I almost found Ec1010a easier than Ec10a at times because the LPs and MCQs were so difficult, and the exams were easier in comparison. Also, definitely go to lecture and do the CRQs, as these also appear on MCQs and exams and are super helpful for deepening your knowledge. And find a study group for the MCQs early!! Overall, this course is hard but super rewarding, and you will walk a way with a very comprehensive understanding of microeconomics.</td>
