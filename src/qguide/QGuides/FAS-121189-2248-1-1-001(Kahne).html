The high grade cutoff is definitely the most difficult part about the course, but overall the pedagogy is really good and you will genuinely have a good foundation for the rest of the science classes you take here, if you do. Dan and Shen are really amazing lecturers and extremely personable. They are an iconic duo, and they make lecture fun and interesting.</td>

			<td class="TabularBody_LeftColumn" headers="comment-2_c5dbd1c5-005c-482e-bf99-ed60fc3913f4">For students without a lot of bio&#x2F;chem experience, this class can definitely be challenging. For students with an AP Bio&#x2F;AP Chem background this class is relatively easy. If you&#x27;re in&ndash;between, I would suggest LPSA (it&#x27;s the same amount of credit with like half the stress). However, if you have AP Bio&#x2F;AP Chem or equivalent experience, LPSA (and even LS1a) is going to be somewhat boring. But, it&#x27;s necessary to continue down life sciences&#x2F;pre&ndash;med track. So here are my most helpful tips. <br/><br/>Find an SSN or an office hour that does PSETs and go to it religiously. I could get my whole PSET done in that session and it would be completely right because you&#x27;re getting the answers checked by a CA or TF. Make sure you have a good section (I loved by TF Collin). Your TF grades labs&#x2F;PSETs and the most learning I ever did in this class was in section. If you do not like your TF or feel like you can&#x27;t learn from them, find a conflict and switch. It&#x27;s not worth it to suffer through. Lectures, Learning Pods, and Readings are all repeats of the same material. If you are pretty well versed in the material, you only really need to do one of them, maybe two (Lecture+1) if you like the review. Lectures are pretty boring, the only thing that got me through them was the Dan&#x2F;Sien dynamic. There is also a lot of wiggle room in this class (2 pset drops, 1 pie drop, lab average, up to 3 lectures missed). My best advice is to not use them early, or even at all. If you&#x27;re gunning for an A, the grade cut off is pretty ambiguous and high and even if you have a 100% in the class, you would still need to get upwards of an 85% on the final to guarantee that A. It helps to give yourself as many points as possible, so don&#x27;t get sucked into using all your drops really quick.</td>

There is very little space for original thinking or curiosity. The way to do well is to just take in what is said in the textbook and in lecture, and repeat it on the problem sets, labs, and exams — if you realize that fast, and act on it by going to office hours or SSN, you’ll succeed. Some people will tell you that you need AP Chemistry or AP Biology or both. I only had AP Biology, and hadn’t taken chemistry since 10th grade,  but they give you all the science you really need to know. So long as you have the ability to surface&ndash;level understand and repeat what is presented in the course materials, you will be fine.</td>

I thought it was taught well and the problem sets, PIEs, and exams were all very fair to students. Dan, Sien, Rebecca, and Richelle were all such engaging lecturers and made the class super fun. The TFs and CAs were also great. Having a background in bio and chem before this class is definitely helpful, but you&#x27;d be able to succeed without it as long as you were willing to put in a bit of extra time to get some more familiarity with the content.</td>

Psets are hard but if you go to office hours every week its not hard to do well on them. The office hours are PACKED so get there early if you don&#x27;t want to sit on the floor.

In terms of content, I felt that LS1b was much more interesting, but this is largely just personal preference. This class requires a lot of work, which can start to feel like busy work—learning pods (recorded lectures), problem sets, labs and lab reports, quizzes called &quot;PIE&quot;s, and midterms.

The first half is very chem heavy while the second is very bio heavy. <br/>The practice problems are an excellent resource for studying for midterms. They don&#x27;t get enough love. They&#x27;re essentially 10 pages of good practice problems with solutions that are testable on the midterms. They&#x27;re also a bit more challenging than the midterms so they provide good prep. <br/>A lot of this class is about explaining phenomena with chemical concepts. A large chunk of the points on psets come from detailed, logical explanations as opposed to  exact answers. <br/>Start lab reports early because the deadline sneaks up on you pretty quickly. <br/>The midterms are much easier than the psets and even easier than the PIEs.</td>

I took it as a sophomore alongside my second semester of organic chemistry because I decided I might declare one of the 6 biology concentrations. I considered taking it as a freshman but decided not to because I felt like I would already know most of the material (spoiler alert I was right). The problem is that there really aren&#x27;t any other super great options for people who are well prepared in science but don&#x27;t want to jump straight in to intermediate level courses. LS50 is your best option, I guess. Anyway, if you took AP Chemistry and AP Bio and felt like they weren&#x27;t very difficult and that you are confident about all the material, this course will be mostly review material&ndash;wise. They are annoying about the grading, though. I was shooting for reporting 2 hours of work outside class between psets, labs and modules, but then I realized that I had to answer the questions really expansively to get most of the points which slowed me down to 3 hours. Also for MCB or PCB, if you don&#x27;t take LS1a or LS1b you have to take higher level courses on the same topics which as far as I can tell is more annoying than just taking LS1a and 1b. My advice is just bite the bullet and take it freshman fall. It won&#x27;t be the greatest class of your college career, but at least you&#x27;ll have gotten it over with and you&#x27;ll have a solid foundation for the rest of college. It&#x27;s a good class to take while you do other stuff &ndash; so for me it was a good balance to Chem 30, (second semester organic chemistry for phys. science majors) which took a lot of time and energy. I would recommend watching the modules while folding laundry &ndash; this motivated me to do it because I would feel so efficient and productive doing both at once. <br/>(This response is geared to people like me who came from really great high schools and have a really solid background in science.

I didn&#x27;t do either and still passed the class with an A. For the learning pods, you can skip through the videos and just answer the questions at the end. <br/><br/>What I recommend is mainly flashcards and practice questions. For each learning pod and reading section, you can download the slides and ask ChatGPT 4.0 (Harvard gives this to you for free) to make you anki flashcards based on the slides. You can then ask GPT to save these as a .csv file and upload these to Anki. Then, do these flashcards daily and constantly add more cards from the upcoming learning pods. Make sure to do the Anki cards for the respective learning pods before each lecture so you can have a clue about what&#x27;s going on. In class, download the lecture slides on your iPad onto Goodnotes and annotate the slides on your iPad as the lecture progresses so you understand what&#x27;s happening. <br/><br/>For PIEs, make sure to study the practice PIE questions and mock PIE. Make notes of your mistakes and repeat missed questions. Don&#x27;t stress too much about missing a few points on the PIEs, they aren&#x27;t worth a great deal of your grade and your lowest score is dropped. As long as you&#x27;re usually performing at the average score or slightly below, you&#x27;ll be fine. I almost always missed a few questions on my PIEs and was still fine. <br/><br/>For Midterms, I recommend doing all the practice questions under each PSET post (check PSETs and practice problems section). The only thing I did for my midterms was review missed PIE and PSET questions and grinded out the practice questions under each PSET and averaged about a 94 on my midterms. <br/><br/>For PSETs and Labs, go to Office hours&#x2F;SSNs and try to work on them a few days earlier than the due date!! You don&#x27;t want to be going to the office hours the day before the PSET&#x2F;lab is due and competing with the hordes of students also trying to finish their PSETs and lab. <br/><br/>Make sure to pay attention in section (this is where you&#x27;ll do a lot of your learning and get a chance to ask a lot of questions) and take advantage of office hours&#x2F;SSNs! Whenever you have questions, definitely get help. Don&#x27;t leave your questions unasked!! <br/><br/>Also, if you&#x27;re debating between this or LPSA, I honestly recommend this! I didn&#x27;t take AP Chemistry and got a 4 on AP Biology and still did well in this course. I learned a lot that I wouldn&#x27;t have learned before and I genuinely enjoyed the professors. I remember when I was deciding between the two and I saw the LPSA syllabus, I recognized a lot of the topics that I had already learned before and I didn&#x27;t want to relearn the same material, so I ended up taking this course and I honestly don&#x27;t regret it! I have friends in LPSA who told me they wish they took LS1A. <br/><br/>In terms of content, this course opens up with a main focus on chemistry, which I really enjoyed, and then goes into biology, basing a lot of the biological concepts in the background chem knowledge that was brought up. There is definitely a larger bio focus than chem in my opinion, but because of the chem in this course, I&#x27;m really considering becoming a chemistry concentrator so there&#x27;s that!<br/><br/>One thing I dislike about this class is that they&#x27;re not upfront about their grade cutoffs and they change the cutoff each year depending on how well others do, but this year, the A cutoff was a 93 or 93.5. For my pre&ndash;meds out there, this course is not designed to be a weed&ndash;out course. There&#x27;s a ton of support and it&#x27;s not hard to succeed in LS1A, just make sure you advocate for yourself and get help when you need it. Make sure to work smarter not harder (active recall&gt;&gt;passive studying), y&#x27;all got this. Good luck!</td>

LPSa counts the same, and will be a much more enjoyable experience if you’re even somewhat weak in chemistry. That being said, there are many real world connections that able to be drawn within this course due to its advanced nature, so it can be interesting to those who do like chem and bio. Also, it’s a premed class that comes with grade deflation (as in grade cutoffs are usually quite high so be ready for an A to be like a 96 and above dependent on the scores of your classmates).

I took AP Chemistry in high school and scored a 5, so I thought that I would be sufficiently prepared for this course. However, the majority of the other students in this course came in with stronger chemistry backgrounds than I did, either having learned chemistry better during AP Chem or even taking courses such as Organic Chemistry. This simply motivated me to work harder, which was required for me to score well. However, because the threshold for an A is essentially determined by the grades of the class, it will likely be challenging (though not impossible) for someone with a low or even moderate chem background to receive an A. A lot of the focus of this course is on biology, too, so taking AP Bio is also super useful. I would recommend this course to anyone who feels extremely confident after having taken AP Chem AND AP Bio, but if not, choose the other route, LPSA. However, keep in mind that upperclassmen students attribute LS1a to better prepare you for upper&ndash;level STEM courses in comparison to LPSA.</td>

I think that Ls1a had an excellent curriculum, and masterfully blended chemistry and biology topics, which made each topic more digestible and understandable. I strongly encourage taking Ls1a for anyone who is looking to get a really strong foundation in these fields. I believe that taking AP Bio and AP Chem prior to taking Ls1a strongly helps make the class more understandable, but you need no real background, so it is possible to take without having taken those courses or an IB equivalent previously. However, LPSA may be more digestible if you didn&#x27;t take AP Bio and AP Chem in high school. <br/><br/>What I like best about this class is that it provides something for everyone, in terms of learning styles. The content is essentially taught three times: learning pods, lectures, and section. The best part is that learning pods provide both videos and textbook readings, which my friends and I are pretty evenly split between. Doing both is great, but usually just one will suffice. Personally, I only use chapters because I struggle to focus in lecture, and I learn pretty well from just reading and taking notes on these chapters. Section is really great for its small environment (~12 students each), which is additionally great for people who can&#x27;t focus on lecture, and either way, it goes into much greater depth than lecture does which is super helpful for clarifying topics.<br/><br/>Generally, I really think this is a great class to take. It is honestly not that difficult if you just put the time and effort in. The midterms and final are extremely fair, and the labs and problem sets aren&#x27;t too time&ndash;consuming or overwhelmingly difficult, but rather help to solidify concepts. I do suggest finding a study group to check your work with, however, as it is easy to make small mistakes on homeworks, and checking has always helped me solidify the concepts in my own brain. Overall, as long as you put the time in, the class is very digestible.<br/><br/>TLDR; take this class if you have already taken AP Chem and AP Bio, or if you just want a fuller foundation in these topics. There is something to fit everyone&#x27;s learning style, and if you simply put in the time to learn in the way that works best for you, the class is very reasonable and super informative thanks to its excellently crafted and integrated curriculum. (Also, great for pre&ndash;meds and non&ndash;pre&ndash;meds. I&#x27;m not pre&ndash;med and I found this class super useful!)</td>

However, after the first weeks, I was quickly brought up to speed and felt comfortable explaining biological processes in chemical terms. My favorite part of the course was the introduction to proteins, as that was when I truly felt like the course integrated biology with chemistry. Problem Sets are often difficult and require you to go back to the e&ndash;Book to understand what is going on, but that is a process I appreciated as I felt like I grasped the material better. Section was my favorite part of the course as I was able to gain better clarity on course content due to the smaller class size.

Instead of complaining about how annoying and frustrating it is at times, I&#x27;ll talk about some tips to keep in mind while taking it so you don&#x27;t struggle too much. <br/><br/>1. Go to office hours and SSN AFTER trying to solve a PSet on your own. It will be hard to do without going, but if you just copy answers without trying to work on it first you won&#x27;t learn anything or understand how you came to certain answers. <br/>2. Do the learning pods. If you don&#x27;t, you&#x27;re at a severe disadvantage because lectures basically highlight the most important parts of the LPs, but if you don&#x27;t do them you won&#x27;t understand the context that everything is being discussed in. <br/>3. Don&#x27;t rely on your cheatsheet too much for midterms; the answers to questions are never going to be a direct copy&#x2F;paste from what you have on the cheatsheet, so make sure you understand the concepts inside out rather than just copying them and hoping they&#x27;ll work.<br/>4. Solve all of the practice PIEs before taking a PIE. The PIEs don&#x27;t deviate much from the practice questions, so if you solve those and understand them well you&#x27;ll be fine.<br/>5. Don&#x27;t submit your PSet more than 10 mins late or they will dock 10% no questions asked which is really brutal (speaking from traumatic experiences after submitting 2 PSets 12 and 13 mins late :&#x2F;)<br/>6. Hang in there!!! Don&#x27;t be discouraged at the start, I promise it gets better once you understand wtf is going on in this course.<br/><br/>Good luck!!!!!!!</td>

The lectures aren&#x27;t always the most interesting or coherent, and sometimes the material is presented in an odd way, but I definitely came out of this class with a stronger understanding of how fundamental chemistry informs cellular biology. I came into this class having self&ndash;studied AP Chem and AP Bio, but having never taken the AP classes themselves. I had seen most of the material before, but LS1a often presented it slightly differently and required a more complete understanding than I was used to. Suffice to say, the first tests HUMBLED me. If you find yourself in a similar position, please seek help! There are a TON of resources available for this class. After scoring in the 70s on the first three PIES and midterm, I spoke with the instructors (super sweet), applied for a personal tutor (incredibly helpful!) and started attending review sessions (1 hour a week and a great way to review outside of section). With that help, I really started to understand the material and earned 100s on the final two PIEs and midterm. Don&#x27;t be afraid to ask for help!!<br/><br/>2) If you&#x27;re a non&ndash;STEM person just looking to fulfill distributional requirements, I would not recommend LS1a. Unless you had an amazing high school science program, it will eat up a lot of your time (3 hour labs guys, plus psets, tests, watch&ndash;at&ndash;home lectures, readings, and lab assignments). Take some other random STEM intro course instead (I&#x27;ve heard great things about Physics 19a).</td>

There are a lot of assignments always going on, so you do need to make sure you&#x27;re keeping an eye on all the different deadlines. Part of that is the PIEs, which are smaller assessments that happen every 1&ndash;2 weeks. That might sound intense, but I&#x27;m honestly a huge fan of spreading out assessments more over the semester.

The analogies made in lecture will live in your head for a lifetime and the course, despite its fast pace, is structured very well giving you multiple opportunities to review. My biggest advice to a future student would be to not let yourself get behind on your coursework! Take advantage of the deliberate structure of the learning pods, lectures and then section&#x2F;lab to fully immerse yourself in the content and you will be successful!</td>

Section leaders are generally quite good. Be aware that lectures are often not the most helpful for understanding course material, and reading the textbook goes a long way in helping you understand. SSNs are very helpful for PSETs and finding people to effectively collaborate with. This is not a terribly hard course if you have an AP bio&#x2F;chem or equivalent background, and the lab work is rather trivial if you have any experience with outside lab work or designing labs in high school, but be prepared to stay on top of the topics as they build on each other, for the large course size, and for the rather competitive environment that surrounds the class due to the high concentration of pre&ndash;med students taking it. Focus on your work and it&#x27;ll be a good course to have taken.</td>

I definitely think it is better to have a pretty strong background in chem and bio before taking this course, especially chem. (Otherwise strongly consider taking LPSA). However, I am someone that enjoys biology more than chem and I enjoyed the focus on chem applications to biology. <br/>The fact that they curve the final grades down at the end of the course is incredibly stressful. I wish they&#x27;d just set the curve before the course begins like many other classes or honestly just make the class harder so they don&#x27;t have to curve down. Also lectures and learning pods are the same and are not helpful. <br/>The lectures are the same content essentially the same as the learning pod videos. Basically, lecture is a waste of time. If this class doesn&#x27;t automatically come super easy to you, especially later on in the class, READ THE TEXTBOOK. It gives unnecessary information but it is so much more helpful than the videos. and the &quot;unnecessary info&quot; allows for a better understanding of the necessary info. <br/>I think a lot about this class heavily depends on your TF. I loved mine but not everyone does and it affects your PSets and labs (25% and 10% of your grade) a lot.</td>

Would recommend coming in with at least introductory bio and chem knowledge. As someone who did take AP Chem and AP Bio, most of the course was review with a few exceptions. I think to make the course accessible to a lot of students coming in with different science backgrounds, a lot of it has to be review.

The reverse classroom format where we learned most of the material before lectures in &quot;learning pods&quot; was not enjoyable, and most people didn&#x27;t even watch them before lecture. My advice would be to watch all the learning pods, go to lecture, and don&#x27;t do the readings unless you are lost, have the time, or want to be extra prepared for exams. The learning pods are almost always enough. The problem sets are difficult, but just find the office hours where they give all the answers, and it will SAVE your grade. Also, getting a nice TF for lab will save your grade so much for the lab component. The 3 hour labs are honestly fine and mostly enjoyable. The section component of the 3 hours helps so much with learning the material. Midterms and final are much easier than problem sets and quite easy overall. Try your best to get high 90s on all of the exams because they cap the number of A&#x27;s they give out. Some years the cutoff is around a 96, but it could be anywhere from a 94&ndash;98 (from what I&#x27;ve heard). Study for PIEs (online tests every two weeks), but don&#x27;t worry too much about them. Anyone from any background can excel in this course, but familiarity with chem (AP chem) helps a good bit for the first month. Just brush up on some basic chem and bio concepts and you&#x27;ll be fine. If you have absolutely no background, just read all the chapters and work a little harder and you&#x27;ll be totally fine. Take exams seriously and don&#x27;t fall behind and you will succeed. Good luck!</td>

It’s easy to misread questions&#x2F;get confused on the midterms&#x2F;PIES, which can bring your overall grade down, and the actual grading scale is a mystery which is really frustrating. But use your resources (especially office hours) and do well on the psets and labs, and you’ll learn a lot.

It felt like a lot of students knew what they were doing, but honestly I did not the whole year. If I could go back, I would get on top of the learning pods and textbook early in the semester. At first, I did not read the textbook and just did the learning pods, but could not understand what I was learning. Then I started to read the textbook, take notes, and highlight things I had in my notes that I heard in the learning pods, I think this was a more helpful approach though I can&#x27;t say I did it much because I was always, always behind. Basiclally would not understand the whole unit, cram a couple days before the tests, not do well on PIE&#x27;s (online quizes every other week) and then do bad on midterms and final. Personally I like chemistry more, which is really only 1&#x2F;3 of the course, so I did good on that first unit and actually did so awful on everything bio related (the other two tests). Also first unit is super fun because Dan and Sien flirt a lot so it makes the lecture  more interesting.<br/><br/>You probaly have to take this class if you know about it for a concentration or pre&ndash;med requirement, so good luck! Also if you are choosing between LPSA and LS1a, I have heard that LPSA is more memory based than this. I think in this class you definintly have to understand the comments and then apply the concepts in the questions. I didn&#x27;t understand the concepts or the questions so honestly super not fun and I wish I did LPSA.<br/><br/>Anyways have a blast if you decide to take this, there are definitly a lot of resources to help you. Go to student study networks, office hours, exam help rooms and use the arc tutoring (legit did it all and still struggled........... but super helpful). Then again a lot of people were way better than me at this class and I had only taken AP chem. Wish I took AP bio, I feel like it could have made the expierience better. <br/><br/>Soooo hope this helps and that you manage your time well better than I did if you decide to take it.</td>

There&#x27;s always an assignment to do or a midterm&#x2F;PIE to study for. The class never really stops, so just make sure you&#x27;re ready for that.</td>

Go to SSNs&#x2F;office hours for help with your PSETS. The material can be a little redundant with learning pods and lecture but its manageable.</td>
