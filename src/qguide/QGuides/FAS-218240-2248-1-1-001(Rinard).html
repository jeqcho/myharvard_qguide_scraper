The lessons learned in this class are something you can take with you no matter what profession or location you choose after college. Professor Rinard does an excellent job of keeping the lectures interesting by offering personal anecdotes and relating them to the challenges of modern life. Refrain from letting the restriction of laptops and pre&ndash;lecture quizzes fool you; the quizzes are easy as long as you dedicate the 30 &ndash; 45 minutes required, and taking notes by hand is proven to help you retain knowledge better than typing. All you need to succeed in this course is what every Harvard student should already have. An open mind, good study habits, and the ability to take notes during a lecture. My TF, Veronika Hammond, was fantastic, and the other students were happy with theirs. This is the type of course that every student should take in their college career.</td>

Professor Rinard was great—her lectures were funny and well&ndash;structured, and I could tell she cared a lot about her students. I don&#x27;t think that it was ultimately gem&ndash;y—we had to write reflections every week, take a quiz every class, write a paper and take two exams BUT the readings were short and had a very high learning&ndash;to&ndash;length ratio. I didn&#x27;t feel like any of the work I had to do for this class was superfluous, and I have applied some of the insights from the course to my life. I would really recommend it.</td>

Super great class to take if you want the opportunity to reflect on what your priorities and approach to life is&#x2F;what you want it to be. I think it really has helped me reprioritize and Rinard is honestly such an icon and inspiration for just doing whatever you want &ndash;&ndash; there are no rules to how you live your life, but these are some guidelines for how to approach it.</td>

Professor Rinard is spectacular in her lectures, explaining philosophers&#x27; ideas through metaphors, jokes and stories from her life. However, make no mistake, it is not a Gem, as you will have to do the readings to complete the quizzes, in addition to reflecting your ideas through the reflection pieces</td>

The amount of work is reasonable, and most of it is graded for completion only. The readings are interesting, especially the ones at the beginning of the year on ancient philosophers. It is a philosophy course, but not a dense, theoretical one, and sections discussions are interesting and applicable to your own life. Overall, this course was super interesting and not too much work, and I&#x27;d strongly recommend it for anyone considering! Also, Allison was an amazing TF :)</td>

There are many small assignments throughout the semester that make sure you are keeping up with the course, and no single assignment determines your grade, so I was never stressed in this class. The amount of assigned reading was also very reasonable, so most people actually do the readings. Overall, one of the better classes I&#x27;ve taken at Harvard despite being a gened.</td>

It is tempting to skip the lecture because it isn&#x27;t ALL that engaging at times, but I found that this is because if you&#x27;re doing a bunch of readings on happiness, they&#x27;re bound to be repetition of ideas that might not be that interesting second time around.  This class shouldn&#x27;t be stressful at all! I honestly really loved this class, and I think y&#x27;all should take it!!

It is an opportunity to reflect on your personal life while learning a bit about philosophy. The content is generally quite interesting and the weekly reflections help you ground it in your own life. The reflections are graded satisfactory or unsatisfactory so they are very low&ndash;stakes. They are just an opportunity for you to apply the material into your own experiences. Lecture is sometimes slow—there were some lectures where I felt we could have covered the content in thirty minutes instead of the seventy five that the class actually lasts. Although lectures are recorded they are not shared with you so pay attention in class because it is basically the only thing you are tested on. Professor Rinard is a great lecturer but there were a couple of lectures that were hard to follow—not because the content was hard, but because the delivery was unstructured. While it has a higher workload than other GenEds, it is still quite manageable.</td>

The readings were interesting and of a reasonable length, but the textbook was expensive (and was new this year so it couldn’t be bought secondhand), and it was just the crustiest pdfs in the world all printed out so it was hard to read on top of being $100 (although hopefully you can get yours secondhand). The midterm and final are very fair, and the oral exam is as well. The attendance policy at least when I took it was fairly punitive – if you were 10 minutes late you counted as absent, and 3 absents from lecture&#x2F;section means you automatically fail the class, which is hard when the shuttles run late. Also, if you have an accommodation allowing you to use your computer to take notes, you will need to talk to her, since the professor does not allow note&ndash;taking on computers unless you have a DAO accommodation – paper or tablets only.</td>

All in all, I think that the class is fairly well&ndash;run.  That being said, only take this course if you want a gem; the material, in my opinion, is taught in a way that is far too shallow for it to be captivating enough to take for its own sake.  I chose this class both for its reasonable workload and because I generally enjoy philosophy and was attracted to the philosophers on the course syllabus.  However, as the course went on, I was disappointed to realize that the philosophy was taught essentially in a sparknote&ndash;esque fashion.  Though this might be necessary if you only spend a week on each philosopher, I think that deeper questions still could have been considered in lecture, throughout section, and in the assignments.  Nothing really spurred growth; it just felt very surface level; unobjectionable but nothing particularly noteworthy.  I left this class feeling that I have a familiarity with some philosophers that I had not read before, such as those from Hinduism or Buddhism, though, to be blunt, I really could have just read a Wikipedia article about one of the philosophers and gotten just as much out of the class.   This is not necessarily bad, as I presume that the course is supposed to be accessible to students of all backgrounds in philosophy, though for those who are philosophically&ndash;inclined, just keep this in mind.  <br/>On a more positive note, I just want to reiterate that I think that the course instructors, particularly Professor Rinard, generally care for the students and want them to grow and enjoy the material.

I think the earlier readings (which are more dense and philosophical) were less enjoyable personally, but I really resonated with parts of what later authors talked about (shoutout Haybron!). The workload is also relatively relaxed&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;as long as you pay attention and do the (relatively short) readings you should be good!</td>

All testing is typically from the lectures so always pay attention and take good notes. It is okay if you don&#x27;t understand the reading. They are meant to be more challenging and the quizzes are straightforward and you will do fine as long as you did the reading. This class is fairly easy but there is a lot of reading and studying involved for exams, so be prepared.</td>

Make sure you complete the reflection assignments &ndash; the Friday deadline was honestly a bit atrocious for me because I would forget about them but you have three drops which is nice. The exams are really fair &ndash; they require you to learn the content but aren&#x27;t immensely challenging as you get a list of topics you need to know in advance. It&#x27;s really helpful to form a study group to compare notes and discuss the prompts before exams. Lectures can be a bit boring but as long as you pay attention and take legible notes, you&#x27;re all set. Section is also great to reinforce the topics!</td>

Attendance is kind of required, there&#x27;s a code in lecture. Exams are very easy and the topics are kind of interesting.

			<td class="TabularBody_LeftColumn" headers="comment-2_1b77b75d-14c1-4755-971f-d2398df6f278">Attendance required! All you have to do to ace this class is show up to class and take good notes, and do the readings ahead of class — they&#x27;re interesting, you&#x27;ll like it! No regular  homework assignments. Essay prompts were fair and interesting and were returned relatively quickly. The lecture is a bit meandering and disorganized, but as long as you get the main ideas from the readings you will be okay. You will get out of this class what you put into it — if you spend a couple hours a week doing the readings (which are short) and you pay attention for at least most of the lecture, you&#x27;re going to do well and enjoy yourself. The readings are great and worth your time — the Bhagavad Gita, Aristotle, Plato, fundamentals of Buddhism and Stoicism, and some interesting contemporary thinkers.</td>

Since I was very young, I have been deeply curious about the meaning of life, the best way to pursue happiness, what even defines happiness, etc. I enrolled in this course in hopes that it would give me a stronger sense of direction and alleviate the creeping feeling that perhaps existence doesn&#x27;t matter at all. Indeed, this class is like a tasting flight of life&ndash;meanings for you to try on! The completion&ndash;graded weekly reflection pieces are a great way to apply concepts from lecture to your own life. The readings don&#x27;t feel like work most of the time—they are of a very manageable length, and they are intrinsically enjoyable.</td>

The quizzes every lecture helped me stay on track and not fall behind on readings or material, and the lectures were often entertaining to listen to. I have talked to some who don&#x27;t agree with me and found the course structure to be stringent, though the coursework can probably feel more difficult if you have no interest in the subject. I truly felt enlightened by some of the readings, while others are not taking the content seriously, so do with that what you will. Happiness is a great opportunity to self&ndash;reflect and rediscover yourself and your values if you are open to that.</td>

You should do well in the class as long as you take notes during lecture. Assignments weren’t too hard, and exams were easy to study for since we got heads up on what to study beforehand. The philosophies weren’t always super interesting, but it’s a good way to get Ethics req out of the way. HUGE SHOUTOUT TO SHANNON THOUGH! She was such a good TF.</td>
