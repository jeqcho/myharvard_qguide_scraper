All the exams and p&ndash;sets are open&ndash;notebook, take home, and for the p&ndash;sets specifically, you&#x27;re encouraged to work together in groups and even use Chatgpt when you&#x27;re stuck. I&#x27;m not a coder in any capacity, and yet, this class was easy to understand after a couple of lectures.

There was some pretty wild miscommunication about assessments, including taking away the autograder on the midterm the day the exam was released. This class was constructed in a way where there was never any incentive to try to learn anything. For Gov people, you have to take it, so there&#x27;s not much to say there. It&#x27;s definitely a better way to fulfill the QRD than Stat100 so if you&#x27;re taking it for that then go for it I&#x27;d say.</td>

If you are in that boat, I would recommend taking this course, as it was far easier for me to conceptualize (however, I have previous stats experience). I did not struggle much, but the policies were particularly lax this semester due to the new lecturer and the recent retirement of Blackwell. I think the curriculum was largely similar to his, so past Q&ndash;guides will be helpful as far as that goes. As far as my experience, I took nothing away from lectures. While the professor was qualified, she was not great at speaking to&#x2F;teaching students anything about the topics. Coding demonstrations were often jumbled and poorly paced, and elaboration on key concepts was severely lacking at the beginning of the course. The class had about 180 students, and about 30 showed up to lecture consistently by the end of the course. The Tf&#x27;s understood the lack of stability and guidance from the instructor (or at least mine did), so that was nice. Overall, I will not take much away from this class. I have not internalized a lot of R code beyond loading libraries and understanding their functions, and the statistical concepts were mostly review or not worth understanding due to the lack of detailed instruction.</td>

I think the lectures sometimes felt too fast or slow but it&#x27;s a new professor working out the kinks and she was very committed to doing so. While I don&#x27;t think I learned enough in R to confidently add it to a resume, I definitely have basic familiarity and was impressed with the visualizations I was able to do with ease by the end of the class that are actually very interesting. You get to look at a lot of relationships related to politics as examples for learning code. Angelo is also a phenomenal TF who you should try to get if possible. This class has to teach to people being forced to take it and who want to take it, so it doesn&#x27;t cater to everyone all the time but it does its best.</td>

Katherine is a wonderful TF and you will learn a lot from going to her section. Section gives you the experience you need to complete the psets and is where I would argue the majority of the learning in this course happens. I wish some improvements were made to lecture. Or perhaps I think this class should just be taught in small sections (I think that would make things a lot better since I think lecture is a difficult format for some of the needed instruction in this class). It is frustrating how sometimes there is a lack of mathematical and statistical precision with the ideas talked about in the class, but I understand that is done in order to make this course as accessible as possible. If you come into this class with a background in math, programming, and&#x2F;or stats (e.g. CS50, Stat 110 etc.), I think some of the concepts might come a bit easier to you relative to those who have not programmed before, but I still think there can be substantial merit in this class since you will inevitably get better at R and will learn to think about data science from a social science perspective</td>

But be sure to work in earnest on the problem sets days before they&#x27;re due, and make sure to turn in drafts of the pset &ndash;&ndash; i.e. versions where only some problems are done &ndash;&ndash; to ensure correctness in the eyes of the autograder. The autograder is terrible and overly finicky. One who consistently waits until the last night will have many a menty&ndash;b over the autograder. Take advantage of the &quot;group office hours&quot; in CGIS on Mondays and Wednesdays; these are extremely helpful for avoiding autograder headaches.

On the midterm, she just gave us pictures of what our answers should look like, which is appreciated, but crazy for a college course. Basically, if you want to learn the material, and show up to every lecture, section, do the problem sets earnestly without the help of AI, attend review sessions, and read the textbook, you&#x27;ll get a lot of knowledge out of this course. If you&#x27;d prefer to slack off, never attend lecture or section, AI generate all of your PSETs &#x2F; test answers, etc, there&#x27;s still a very high chance you&#x27;ll get an A, especially if you have an inkling of coding knowledge.<br/><br/>Professor seemed nice, but disappointed with the pedagogy of GOV50, which is supposed to be a foundational class for data science in government.</td>

There aren&#x27;t a lot of strategies for getting social sciences concentrators engaged or supports for orienting them to computer sciences. The pedagogy is very different in that it is highly technical, but I would still say the course is worth taking nonetheless to learn new methods, a new skill, and a new way of learning. The course isn&#x27;t impossible and there are a lot of supports so that you can perform and get a good grade if you put the work in. The teaching staff want you to do well.</td>

Go to the section and find a TF that you resonate with. For your final project, start as soon as you hear about it. Look at the final project and compare it to the different steps of the milestones, then complete each milestone using that outline. Please, please, please reach out to your TFs for assistance if you are struggling (they will help!). The coding you learn in this class is actually helpful and is a great starting point for more coding and analytics in whatever field you get into.</td>

It’s particularly useful for beginners, as it provides a step&ndash;by&ndash;step introduction to key concepts and tools that are directly applicable to social science research. The assignments are practical and manageable, helping you develop skills that can be used in real&ndash;world analysis. However, while the course content itself is solid, the lectures might not feel as engaging or essential to attend. Many students find they rely more on the assignments and self&ndash;study to get the most out of the course, as the teaching team tends to operate at a level that can feel a bit disconnected from where beginners are starting. Overall, if you’re looking for a straightforward and useful way to check off your QRD requirement while learning some valuable skills, this course is a good option.</td>
