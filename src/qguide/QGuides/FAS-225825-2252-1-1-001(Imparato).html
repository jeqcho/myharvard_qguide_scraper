Professor Imparato is a great lecturer and clearly puts a great deal of time and care into the class &ndash; he knows everyone by name and always makes himself available for office hours and meals. He also did a great job at ensuring that participating in lecture was not intimidating.  Sections also provided good opportunities to expand the scope of conversations we had. I wish the lectures spent a bit more time on content&#x2F;insights from the readings rather than just passing the mic around the room. Great course overall.</td>

He genuinely cares about every student in his class and makes an effort to learn more about them in and out of the classroom. He hosts countless office hours and meals and even supports students at their sports games, shows, etc. His lectures were also so engaging and interesting! He did an amazing job facilitating discussion and debates despite the classroom size of over 300 students. I recommend everyone to take his class even if you aren&#x27;t concentrating in government, biotech, etc. You will leave this class with a completely different perspective on life. Biotech Ethics is one of the few classes here that had every student constantly engaged and excited to participate.</td>

This class is so interesting and engaging, and Imparato genuinely cares about all his students. He works hard to remember everyone&#x27;s name, and spends all his time going to student&#x27;s performances and sports games to ensure the class feels like a community. This class reinvigorated a sense of passion for learning within me&ndash;&ndash;and as a senior, that feeling has sometimes been hard to find. This class isn&#x27;t traditional and encourages participation, but the topics are so interesting (abortion, plasma transfusions, brain chips, physician&ndash;assisted suicide, artificial wombs, etc) that you will want to participate. Even though it&#x27;s a larger class, I&#x27;ve never felt such community, and the TFs are all amazing. You will also learn a lot about Kant, Bentham, Aristotle, Foucault, etc., but they are broken down in ways that are so easy to comprehend. This is a MUST&ndash;TAKE!!!

Professor Imparato is amazing and makes such an amazing effort to get to know everyone in his 300+ person class in a way I had never seen before— by the end of the semester he grabbed a meal at least once with every student and knew everyone&#x27;s names. I am confident that it is things like these that led to such amazing discussions in lecture where everyone actively participated, sharing their opinions and being open to changing their minds by listening to others.

Professor Imparato is one of the best lecturers at Harvard &ndash;&ndash; he successfully engaged an enormous class in rigorous, difficult discussions about emerging technologies that may change the way we relate to one another and even challenge our conception of what it means to be a human being. Prof Imparato is a gifted lecturer who is clearly passionate about the material and his students&#x27; learning. He cultivates an environment of open&ndash;minded exchange, where students are comfortable voicing their opinions on controversial topics. He is also deeply invested in his students&#x27; development, learning and well&ndash;being &ndash;&ndash; as evidenced by his incredible track record of meeting with students for (remarkably frequent) meals over the course of the semester. The conversations in this course will follow you outside the classroom. I spent hours every week discussing the topics with friends — some of whom were in the class, and some of whom simply wished to hear about the latest innovations and ethical challenges in biotech.<br/><br/>Professor Imparato&#x27;s philosophy of education is that learning should not feel like work. Learning, instead, is an exercise in contemplation. I never felt like I was working in this class, but certainly put more time into it than most other classes and got so much more out. <br/><br/>Prof Imparato does an admirable job of generally avoiding sharing his own views on the controversies we cover — instead allowing students to formulate their own opinions and disagree constructively with one another. <br/><br/>The one exception was his last lecture—entitled &quot;Tech, biotech, and the future of human nature&quot;—where he concluded the class by sharing his own stances on some of these emerging technologies, as well as his broader views on human nature and what makes life meaningful. This lecture was the single best lecture I have ever heard at Harvard, and it was the first one to make me cry.</td>

You do not need any philosophical prior knowledge, this course very much leverages you slowly into the various philosophers.

For context, I was not originally enrolled in this class or even willing to consider enrolling in it (I was not particularly interested in Biotech, and I had taken a health care policy class that I had high expectations from but was disappointed by, so I worried I would have a similar experience in this class).  However, when I sat in to one of the lectures with a friend, I was immediately sold and never looked back. Both the content and the structure of this class is rewarding. If you have a background in philosophy and have read many of the thinkers on the syllabus, the contexts in which we apply the frameworks is very different from what you likely have encountered before. Even if the contexts are the same, the perspectives you will hear &ndash;&ndash; as guided by the professor &ndash;&ndash; are different. If you have a background in biotech ethics, this class provides you an entirely different experience. As for the structure, this does not function as a normal lecture. Instead of the professor repeating the content of the readings verbatim and offering no room for application or discussion or debate, Professor Imparato does a phenomenal job at creating what feels like a seminar&ndash;like environment in what is a massive lecture hall. He also provides many opportunities to engage with the students outside of the class. I have had classroom to tables and office hour opportunities in other classes to connect with professors, but Professor Imparato hosts ~3 meals&#x2F;week in every house&#x27;s dining hall&#x2F;Annenberg, in addition to standard office hours. In these out of class conversations, he does a great job of blending discussions on readings and external topics. Not to mention, he&#x27;ll do things like bring bread to his office hours, which is completely aligned with Professor&#x27;s kind and humble nature. Additionally, in a lot of classes where I may not have constant assignments to turn in each week, I feel less bought into the class and find myself leaving without having gained as much. However, with this class, even with &ndash;&ndash; or maybe because of &ndash;&ndash; the relatively minimal assignments, I found myself more able to spend more thorough time on the readings as opposed to rushing through busy work. All in all, this was exactly the kind of education I was hoping to get out of Harvard. My viewpoints were challenged, I was exposed to new topics while refining my understanding of past knowledge, and I felt connected with my peers and teaching staff in the class. Everyone should add this class to their schedule before they graduate!</td>

Professor Imparato is makes engagement a big part of the class, so much so that he made it a point to meet and eat with all 300+ of his students at least once. The content is a really interesting way to look at philosophy and morality, especially as someone who&#x27;s not very interested in philosophy in other contexts. The readings were not essential to understanding what was happening in class for the most part, though I&#x27;d recommend doing them before classes that are more theory&ndash;focused. Great class and will always recommend!</td>

He wrote hand&ndash;written cards for each of the 300 or something students in the class on the last day of school. He makes time to have meals with students and discuss with them. I found myself talking with roommates and friends about biotech ethics questions we had discussed in class all the time. Would strongly recommend for people regardless of a background in science or ethics. Super interesting stuff. Amazing class</td>

I will say however that the science discussed here is sometimes quite unrealistic. It&#x27;s also not at all related to SCRB (as an HDRB concentrator). Some of the topics are reasonable like PAS and aging (although I found that the aging discussions were far more immortalist than true aging bio research that&#x27;s more focused on multimorbidity prevention). It was interesting hearing non&ndash;scientists&#x27; perspectives on different topics that we find pretty normal in science like organoids, etc. Definitely changed my perspective on how we as scientists should portray our work to the public.</td>

			<td class="TabularBody_LeftColumn" headers="comment-2_6666f6b3-7cd9-4071-8e91-89ab53f0c075">This course is intellectually fulfilling in specifcially in the way that an ethics class should be. Sometimes I found people were doing way too much virtue signalling during lectures &ndash; stating opinions that were extremely impractical and also suggested a lack of understanding of real world nuance. Other than that, though, it was generally an interesting class and the sections were definitely engaging enough to make me strongly recommend the course. Outside work is limited which gives you time to kind of think about and develop stronger opinions about the course material if you choose to. If you dont, however, you can probably still get an A as the class is mostly just about participation.</td>

This was like a more interesting and applied version of Justice. Note that at least in this iteration of the class, your grade was very heavily based on participation, and so you really do have to push yourself to speak in section and engage with the class since that is the only way to do well. There&#x27;s pretty much no work, which can be nice but stressful when you feel like you have little control over how you do.</td>

As long as you skim the readings, pay attention in class, and participate in section, you&#x27;ll do great!</td>
