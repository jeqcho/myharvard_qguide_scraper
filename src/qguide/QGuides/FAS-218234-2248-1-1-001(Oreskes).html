It is incredibly interesting, and the topics discussed are pertinent to all students, regardless of your concentration or interests. There is a TON of readings to complete each week, and it can be a lot of work at times. In hindsight, I&#x27;m glad I did it, though. Nonetheless, if you did the readings, participated in discussion, and completed the work, it was relatively simple to get good grades. My TF was generous with grading, so I was able to focus on learning instead of the grades.</td>

Do not do them all.<br/><br/>Want to get participation in section? Read 1 and be prepared to talk about just that article.<br/>Want to just finish your 500&ndash;600 word weekly required writing (that requires 3 sources)? Read the 3 shortest articles and write about them.<br/>Want to be prepared for the exam? Read one medium&#x2F;long article and 2 other shortest&#x2F;related articles for your 500&ndash;600 word weekly writing. This is about the amount of depth necessary for meaningful section participation and likely the midterm. Your two papers can probably rely on this as well.<br/><br/>Just lock in on those 3 weekly readings and you will be fine. The class eventually starts to become routine. Even the lectures start to repeat themselves at some point.<br/><br/>You will get 2 dropped discussion posts, which is nice. Lateness is not generally accepted, but can be if you get a good section leader.<br/><br/>I will say, this class really did open my eyes to the effects of climate change and consumerism. It&#x27;s not advertised as a class about climate change, and although that&#x27;s what you expect, you actually see that much of the class revolves around the culture of climate change. Music, religion, politics. Beautiful stuff. Good GenEd. Mauro is a good section leader. Oreskes is a good lecturer. Not much else to say there.</td>

Manageable workload, but at times a lot of reading. The weekly discussion posts can get kind of annoying, but you have two drops to use. Prof. Oreskes is a force within the field; I learned a lot from her arguments and experience. The two response papers and exams are super manageable. I&#x27;d recommend this course, but this is definitely a get out what you put in class so you can choose to slack off and not learn a ton, but I&#x27;d recommend trying to do most of the readings and pay attention in lecture since it will be more rewarding.</td>

The lectures are the most awesome part of this class, so please, please attend lecture and just listen for 75 minutes, it is so worth it. Readings are also quite interesting (a bit long...), but super super interesting and challenges many of the viewpoints ingrained in us just by being at Harvard. Be warned though, compared to other Geneds, i do fear it is a bit more work, but i truly do feel that the quality and engagement of the lectures and readings was enough to balance everything out.</td>

The grading is unnecessarily harsh (TF takes off .1 .2, .3 points) on weekly discussion posts, which are simply meant to be a reflection. I think being so harsh on a reflection&ndash;based discussion post prevents students from being truly authentic in their responses. <br/>I also believe Professor Oreskes sometimes does not do a good job of respecting students&#x27;s diverse opinions and perspectives. Especially because this was the year of the election at times it felt like she was trying to emphasize the necessity for a Democratic government, which made it hard for me to express my views as a student with a more conservative background. It felt like my views and political views were not welcomed nor respected in this class.</td>

			<td class="TabularBody_LeftColumn" headers="comment-2_042b88bd-c91d-460d-be42-bc566a23e623">It is hard to be critical of a course with such an amazing lecturer; still, this course has a lot of room for improvement, and I would think twice before taking it.<br/><br/>Lectures are engaging, but they sometimes feel disconnected from the content covered in the readings. To paint a picture: lectures for a given week discussed the concept of interdependence as theorized by philosophers and historians of science, yet the corresponding lecture focused on Mars colonization projects by Musk and Bezos. Such mismatches were frequent throughout the course. <br/><br/>There is something interesting to be said about the course&#x27;s pedagogy as well. Every week, you have to read approximately six 30&ndash;page fragments, all from different sources by different authors. You then have to write a 600&ndash;word discussion post that incorporates at least three of these readings, drawing connections and presenting a cohesive argument. This is pretty easy (I got full credit for all discussion posts), but it felt like an incredibly shallow engagement with the material. The sheer number (key word: number, not volume; 180 pages per week is very fair) of readings meant there was little time to truly absorb or reflect on any one piece, let alone grapple with the nuances of the authors’ arguments. Instead, the focus seemed to be on quickly identifying surface&ndash;level connections and churning out responses that ticked the boxes of the rubric. It is very ironic that a course ostensibly critiquing systems of speed and efficiency undermining critical engagement will replicate those same structures in its pedagogy.<br/><br/>TLDR; Good lectures, but poor course structure and unsatisfactory assignments. Not necessarily hard to get a good grade, but somewhat frustrating if you care about learning.</td>

Oreskes is a wonderful lecturer and she presents the information in such an engaging and digestable way. I learned a lot in this class, but I also learned to think critically about the information that is presented to us in courses. While the class is a little difficult because of the immense amount of information that is presented within the semester, if you stay on top of the readings and stay engaged in the lecture, you will do well! I cannot recommend this class enough. I believe that this is a course that all students should take.</td>

Professor Oreskes is so intelligent and engaging. We explore a broad range of perspectives and approaches, which was really educational and helped me realize how limited my own worldview was. It&#x27;s more reading than is typical for a gen ed, but between the readings, lectures, and sections I think I&#x27;ve legitimately learned more about the world around me in a way that I never have from a single class.

I definitely feel more informed about why the nation&#x27;s climate policy (or lack thereof) is the way it is, and am able to recognize for the first time the complex geopolitical and cultural nuances of climate inaction and misinformation. While this class is definitely sobering, it was also deeply inspiring at times, especially when we got to hear from speakers who were tackling the climate crisis in nonconventional ways. In discussing the climate crisis from a wide range of perspectives, this course helps you realize that this is a fight everyone can and should contribute to, and I think this is a message that isn&#x27;t emphasized in a lot of courses at Harvard. It&#x27;s nice to leave a course feeling empowered to use your skills and passions for a greater cause.</td>

Professor Oreskes is interesting and a great lecturer, the course staff, especially Mauro, are fantastic and very engaged,  and the subject matter is incredibly relevant to everyday life. This class changed the way that I see climate change and maybe my choice of career as a result. That said, while it is a good choice for a GenEd, it is not a class to be taken lightly. Not only are there a lot of readings and a discussion post every week that is rather lengthy, but you actually have to read everything in moderate depth to do well on the assignments and get a lot out of it. If you&#x27;re willing to put up with the work, it&#x27;s a fantastic course and you will learn a lot about climate change.</td>

You go over many factors and disciplines that connect to climate change, such as history, music, religion, and more. This interdisciplinary aspect of the course was the best part in my opinion because it&#x27;s not something that you can easily find online, but it&#x27;s still so important to know about. However, I didn&#x27;t like the course was run. I had to switch TFs, and I&#x27;m so glad I did because Fabian was the best! The grading on some of the assignments also didn&#x27;t make sense, and there were so many readings per week (plus a weekly discussion post about them). These factors led me and my friend to take this class pass&#x2F;fail, but it was fine otherwise.</td>

Grading seemed strict as GENEDs seemingly were &quot;calibrating&quot; grades differently to deflate them. You will need to put a lot of work in to ensure an A in this class given they seem wary of having everyone do too well. Aside from grading, this course has changed my perspective on the importance and urgency of combatting climate change and I enjoyed the interesting weekly readings.</td>

			<td class="TabularBody_LeftColumn" headers="comment-2_042b88bd-c91d-460d-be42-bc566a23e623">TLDR: I could not stand this course.<br/><br/>I started very interested in this course&#x27;s material. I am NOT at all a climate change denier, and I was excited to hear what Oreskes, a leader in climate policy, had to say about solutions for the future. I really believe that climate change is an extremely important issue that should be talked about more often. I say this to set the scene for the utter disappointment I experienced throughout this course. <br/><br/>I absolutely LOVED my section leader, and always enjoyed the discussion between students, however, I quickly became very dissatisfied with both the readings and the lecture components of the course (and eventually the exam). <br/><br/>The week&ndash;to&ndash;week readings are altogether too long for a student with literally anything else going on to reasonably complete in totality. Additionally, many of them became very repetitive. <br/><br/>There are cases where I have had professors that I didn&#x27;t completely agree with, and I found their honesty refreshing. However, I found Oreskes to be incredibly condescending nearly every lecture. She OFTEN fueled the humanities vs STEM debate that is already too rampant on this campus. Furthermore, she is incredibly anti&ndash;technology and spent many weeks discussing her anti&ndash;technology stance. In this dialogue, she often spoke down on engineers and scientists, while many such students sat in the lecture hall. She invites many guest lecturers, yet NEVER invited a guest that opposes her own personal opinions on &quot;Life and Death in the Anthropocene.&quot; Even though there are several Harvard professors that are oppositional to Oreskes (even some that have worked on climate technologies directly). Additionally, there were several times when she would make incredibly condescending comments directly to students during class. In totality, I found her incredibly rude and unapproachable. <br/><br/>My final qualm with this course was the midterm exam grading. I studied for the exam. I took the exam. I received a score that I, personally, was not satisfied with. YET I RECEIVED ZERO FEEDBACK. If you are going to dock points on an essay&ndash;style GENED midterm, you need to explain yourself. The final exam was in the same style. So, how was I supposed to improve from midterm to final if I received zero midterm feedback? That is unclear to me.</td>

But it is incredibly helpful in building a really interdisciplinary understanding of the climate crisis, its causes, and why it&#x27;s so difficult for us to address it. You will definitely learn some really important concepts and gain new ideas and frameworks of thinking about this crisis, but you will probably also get what you put into it.</td>

I really enjoyed attending class. Unfortunately, a lot of the readings (over 100 pages per week), which form the basis of most of the assignments and section, were a bit stale. They are also oddly strict about grading. If you&#x27;re looking for a way to fulfill your GENED req, this probably isn&#x27;t the best way unless they change the course structure a little.</td>

Some of the readings were really interesting (although very standard for a climate class at Harvard; I&#x27;d seen a lot of them before). The class also really only presented Prof. Oreskes&#x27; opinions&ndash;&ndash;while I learned a lot from her perspective things got repetitive after a while.

The course covers a wide range of perspectives on the climate crisis, from different diagnoses of its origin (capitalism, imperialism, religion, etc.) as well as various approaches for solving it (via technology, policy, social change, etc.). This class exceeded my expectations in the sense that people were engaging really deeply with the readings and I always looked forward to the conversations we would have in section about the material. My TF, Ashton, was super incredible as well &ndash; he was really the ideal TF: kind, understanding, honest, and excited to teach.<br/><br/>But &ndash; and this is a BIG but &ndash; Naomi Oreskes is an exceptionally poor professor. She is very likely the worst instructor I have ever had, not just at Harvard, but in my life. Naomi is opinionated and self&ndash;centered. She brings a ‘jack of all trades, master of none’ background to her teaching (with an emphasis on ‘master of none’), which is fine, but she is so head&ndash;strong in her beliefs that she ends up teaching her students things that are just patently false or internally inconsistent with other things she has said. The lectures present a one&ndash;sided interpretation of the causes and solutions for climate change, and sorely lack critical discussion of different perspectives or fact&ndash;based analysis.<br/><br/>Let me first give a disclaimer. Naomi seems like a good person. She seems friendly and like someone who would be easy to get along with in other aspects of life. But when it comes to discussing the climate crisis and how to solve it, Naomi is one of the most ignorant people I have ever met. And the fact that she force feeds her own beliefs to her students &ndash; when these beliefs are based off of incorrect information or internally inconsistent assumptions &ndash; is unacceptable.<br/><br/>Here’s one example of Naomi simply not understanding the content she tries to teach. We had several lectures about the shortcomings of nuclear power &ndash; mainly that nuclear power plants take a long time to build and that nuclear fusion still isn’t commercially viable. That’s all great. But at one point, when criticizing small modular nuclear reactors, Naomi argued that small modular reactors will never be as cost&ndash;effective as larger nuclear plants since building smaller reactors means they won’t be able to benefit from economies of scale. This statement reflects a fundamental misconception of economic theory: economies of scale have nothing to do with the size of the product itself. In fact, the entire purpose of building small *modular* nuclear reactors is that they are modular, and therefore can be mass produced in factories and then transported to sites for installation, rather than having to be custom built each time. Small modular reactors are designed exactly so that they can benefit from economies of scale, in contrast to traditional nuclear power plants. It’s remarkable that at a school like Harvard, home to some of the top economists in the world, there are still professors like Naomi who do not understand Econ 101. And this is just one example of Naomi teaching things that are just objectively incorrect.<br/><br/>Naomi is also constantly contradicting her own beliefs. Throughout the entire course, she presents internally inconsistent beliefs about the importance of technology and scientific research. On one hand, she stresses that the US federal government has historically played a major role in many technological inventions, and should be seen as an equally valuable source of innovation as the private sector. On the other hand, she is highly skeptical of government investment in clean energy technology R&amp;D today and derided the French government for investing in nuclear power. I left the course confused about what Naomi really thinks about technological solutions for climate change, and honestly am not sure if she has a coherent opinon on technology. Naomi tends to cherry pick success stories and failures to teach to the class, and it ends up painting a patchwork picture of climate solutions that doesn’t yield any coherent conclusion. It feels like she just latches on to certain narratives she hears in the media, and doesn’t really critically evaluate her own beliefs and consider if they are internally consistent or not.<br/><br/>There was another lecture where she spent half the time convincing us that going to Mars was not a viable solution for addressing climate change. We know, Naomi, we know. You didn’t have to spend 45 minutes monologuing about the difficulty of timing a launch so that Earth and Mars are closest together or about the governance challenges of establishing an extraterrestrial colony. This is yet another example of Naomi not really having anything meaningful to teach, and just offering a semi&ndash;coherent rehashing of her shower thoughts with questionable relevance to the course.<br/><br/>Naomi is also quite self&ndash;centered. We would barely go a single lecture without her name&ndash;dropping one of her celebrity friends, or her bringing up that she was invited to give a talk at XYZ conference, or that some news station interviewed her, or that her book has been made into a film, blah blah blah blah blah. It honestly just felt professionally inappropriate.<br/><br/>You might be wondering about Naomi’s qualifications. She has a PhD in geology, and is now a professor of history of science. Why did she make the switch? She told us in lecture that history of science was a less competitive field than geology. I’m not sure what part of her academic background makes her qualified to discuss the engineering or economic challenges of climate change. And I would have thought that any professor who is teaching content outside of their field of expertise would have at least taken the time to create lectures that are factually correct and logically consistent with each other, but that did not seem to be the case with this course.<br/><br/>So Naomi, if you’re reading this, I ask you to please reconsider the way you teach this class. You are obviously capable of running a good class, since you are a tenured professor and have been teaching for decades, but I fear this course is over&ndash;ambitious in its content and the lectures are often not grounded in facts or logic. I hope that you can be just a little more moderated when you are presenting your own beliefs and that you really fact check everything you’re saying before you teach it to dozens of undergrads. If you really want to inspire the next generation of climate leaders, you need to re&ndash;evaluate the way material is presented in lecture. I hope that you can encourage your students to think critically about the complex causes and solutions of climate change, rather than force feed them your personal beliefs that can be premised on factually incorrect statements or internally inconsistent assumptions. You have a year until you teach this course again. I hope you can make use of it.</td>
