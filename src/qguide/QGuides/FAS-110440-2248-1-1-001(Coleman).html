If you have a solid English background and love reading, definitely apply!<br/><br/>The actual work is mostly reading, and beside working on two papers each semester, there isnt any other homework to do. My peers in expos we spending a lot more time on their assignments than I did reading. The sections are hit or miss, and I was lucky to have an amazing section with Professor McCarthy. If you are on edge about this class because of its difficulty, just know that you will come out not only with a new outlook on life and a brand new book collection, but also a much more refined writer and literary critic. You will also make friends in this class because the same people you meet in section will also be in writing lab.</td>

The main takeaway from the class is exposure to authors and texts and ideas. I would say it is less about how to read and write than an introduction to the Western canon. I&#x27;m glad I took the course and would recommend it to anyone interested in literature.</td>

It is a lot of reading and if you don&#x27;t read a majority of the books, then by the time the final comes you will be unprepared. The final is not hard, but it is created to see if you read the books, so if you read the books or as much as you can, you will be better prepared for the exam. In terms of writing, I feel like the course has helped me improve my writing skills, but remember that to get the Expos credit you must take it both semesters, so if you want more room to take something else, or would rather to just get the Expos credit done with, this might not be the course for you. Overall, I&#x27;m glad to have taken the course, but I would this has been a mixed bag of a course for me. Some weeks were better based off of the books and how much I liked them, and the amount of discussion in seminars will be based off of how much your peers liked the books, so some weeks might just not be it. Keep that in mind.</td>

It is okay if you do not enjoy the lectures or do not always value the conversations in sections, but you should read the texts for personal growth and to ensure scoring well.

This course attracts some of the most varied and eccentric minds in the entire freshman class, I would argue that it is the most eclectic group of people at Harvard bar none. The teaching staff are incredible, they&#x27;re all experts in not only their field of study but the books that they lecture on. In terms of difficulty, do not believe everything you hear. There are only two graded assignments throughout the semester, and then you read one book a week which is really not that difficult. To not take this course would be a tragedy beyond belief. Where&#x2F;when else will you get this opportunity again? The final exam was my only point of contention with this course. While I got an A, it was atrociously run and planned, but don&#x27;t let that dissuade you from taking HUM10.</td>

More than the lectures, more than the essays, more than the section discussions (all excellent ways to expand your understanding of the humanities) you will grow by developing thinking, feeling relationships with these texts. You can get away with skimming, and some do, but you&#x27;d do much better to take Expos if the size of the syllabus is a downside to you. Ultimately, Hum 10, in order to not be a frustrating or hurried experience, requires an optimism and hopefulness that you exercise outside of the class much more than inside the lecture hall or section classroom.<br/>By far the most exciting times from this course were spent in the hallway just before section started, hearing students excitedly talk about the previous weeks reading. The materials in this course are genuinely some of the most humanizing, thought&ndash;provoking, and emotional works I&#x27;ve ever read, and the lectures give you such a great way to approach them and make something of your own out of them.</td>

This is fine, and the history is fascinating and fun, but when there is a text you really struggle with, be it for the content, style, or even the discussion around it, the lecture will likely disappoint.<br/><br/>Of course, I still recommend this class, definitely, as the texts are mostly fantastic, and to take them with the professors of Hum10 is incredible &ndash;&ndash; though the expectation is all.</td>

These are books that you will want to read before you leave college, and this course gives students that opportunity while also fulfilling the writing requirement. Also, meeting professors from the philosophy, classics, and literature departments (and more) helps you to get a taste of each of these disciplines early in your career.</td>

Yes, it&#x27;s a lot of reading, but most of it is genuinely enjoyable and offers a break from your other work (especially if you&#x27;re in a lot of STEM classes). And honestly, watching my friends suffer through expos... I wouldn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s that much more work. The final is definitely a ton of material, but you&#x27;ll look back on the studying and be happy you did it &ndash;&ndash; it really reinforces concepts and brings your class closer together. On that note &ndash;&ndash; yes, some of the people can be a bit snobbish&#x2F;pretentious, but they&#x27;re also some of the most thoughtful readers you&#x27;ll meet and a lot are genuinely there just because they love to read and talk about books in a serious way.

I truly believe this is one of the best classes offered at Harvard. The team&ndash;taught format is incredibly enriching. Not only was it an amazing opportunity to learn from some of the most expert professors across humanities departments, but their passion for the works they taught made each lecture truly moving. All the professors were so willing to talk to students, fuel our interest in the books we read, and go beyond what we discussed in lectures. Definitely go to office hours and make full use of the unparalleled opportunity to engage with so many brilliant professors, beautiful works of literature, and a great group of self&ndash;selected peers. Even if you don’t initially think you have interest in a particular book, still do try to approach it with the same thought– you will get so much more out of lecture and might be surprised by how much you end up enjoying it.</td>

The books are definitely very Classic and lots of books from ancient Greece, but I realized that they are all quite necessary for understanding any Western literature we read. Most people who take this class are also passionate about learning, so if you have a good section discussions are a lot of fun. If you&#x27;d more guidance on your writing however, probably not the best, although the TF&#x27;s are very helpful and will conference with you.

The professors are brilliant, kind, and thoughtful; the students are smart and genuinely engaged by the material; and the texts are ones I&#x27;ll be thinking about for the rest of my life. I&#x27;ve become a better reader and thinker, and more than that, I&#x27;ve been able to understand foundational texts via lectures from intellectuals who are renowned for their work on said texts (think Stephen Greenblatt and Shakespeare). I looked forward to lecture every week; whether providing historical context or close&ndash;reading the texts, the professors pulled together something truly wonderful. If you&#x27;re thinking about concentrating in anything in the humanities, I would recommend taking this course. <br/><br/>My only reservations:<br/><br/>1) Even though this course fulfills the Expos requirement, you will not learn to be a better writer from it (or your experience will vary greatly depending on your TF). There&#x27;s no writing practice outside of two essays; I have not improved as a writer over the course of the semester.<br/><br/>2) Be warned that some students are, yes, overeager to show off their knowledge. There will be people who stroll into lecture asking you why you haven&#x27;t read Purgatorio or Paradiso in Dante&#x27;s Commedia; there will be people making oblique connections to Nietzsche not because they know what they&#x27;re talking about, but they want to *seem* like they know what they&#x27;re talking about. Be ready to distinguish between  people who are genuinely smart and interesting and people who are simply &quot;well read&quot; (or think they are well read). That being said, I&#x27;ve met some of my closest friends through this class; there are some truly amazing, brilliant people, and they far outweigh the irritating ones.<br/><br/>3) At Visitas, they will tell you this is not a &quot;great books&quot; course. It is 100% a &quot;great books&quot; course. While it&#x27;s not advertised as the Western canon, it essentially is... it&#x27;s a bit saddening considering that equivalent courses at other universities (think Stanford, for example) will read texts like the Epic of Gilgamesh and the Quran, but we don&#x27;t. Course leads have said that it&#x27;s a faculty&#x2F;staffing issue, but that&#x27;s even worse, in my opinion — you don&#x27;t have enough non&ndash;Western scholars to have non&ndash;Western texts in the course? That isn&#x27;t to say that you won&#x27;t learn from the course — you will — but just know that you&#x27;re going into a Western lit class. <br/><br/>Overall, however, the advantages overwhelmingly outweigh the disadvantages. This is a class I&#x27;ll be thinking about through winter break — it&#x27;s where I have learned the most, and seen genuine &quot;intellectual vitality&quot; (if they&#x27;re still throwing that buzzword around when you&#x27;re reading this).</td>

However, I would caution anyone considering this course to think about what experience they want to get from it.  Since the only real &#x27;reading checks&#x27; are the two papers and the final, the true incentive to actually read the books and to read them deeply can only come from within yourself. Therefore, it is very easy to get caught up into a cycle of skimming the books, instead of deeply reading them unless you have a firm reading schedule coming into the semester. While I consider skimming to not really constitute a real &#x27;read&#x27; of a book, you might feel differently. Ultimately, everyone&#x27;s definition of what constitutes a proper &#x27;read&#x27; is individual; nevertheless, you should take that into account when deciding whether or not to take this course.<br/>On a separate note, the two papers and the 3hr written final exam are very fairly graded and directly correlate to one&#x27;s understanding of the texts.</td>

			<td class="TabularBody_LeftColumn" headers="comment-2_84802497-1dd1-4729-b956-78b787a3028a">HUM10 is an excellent choice if you&#x27;re excited about the prospect of reading the foundational texts on the syllabus and finding connections between them. While the course is not perfect, and may not feel especially new if you came from a high school that emphasized literature, it is special in its focus on the pace at which you move. Though you clearly can&#x27;t expect to gain a truly in depth understanding of each book on the reading list (and though the lecture quality will vary), at the end of the course, if you have put in effort on your part, you will find you&#x27;ve gained both an expanded lexicon of literary terminology to draw upon and an array of cultural references that will contribute to your understanding of the humanities and their evolution. The people you will meet in this course are fantastic&ndash;&ndash;most are people who are truly excited by the humanities, and by their educational experience in the class. <br/>The main aspect of the course I feel could be improved is that of the section. From what I had gathered by the end of the semester, sections were run very differently and to varying degrees of success; there is a chance you will end up with a section leader who, though a great lecturer and fantastic thinker, is not the best at facilitating focused discussion. This is one thing the course does not do; for an introductory course in the humanities, it is oddly devoid of at least a standardized list of suggestions and expectations on how to engage with the texts, which means everyone comes in with different levels of confidence, and that that is never really remedied.<br/>I would recommend this course because of the reading load and the people. I do feel as if I&#x27;ve grown as a consumer of literature, and the environment was one in which I&#x27;ve met some of my best friends to date. I think this is a better option for an expository writing course than expos. The professors and TFs are great and willing to engage with you&ndash;&ndash;definitely attend as many office hours as you can. The only caveat is that if you are hoping to take a hard English class in terms of writing and new thinking, you may be better served by taking a class in the department itself.</td>

Hum10 has an incredible, tight&ndash;knit community with an amazing group of students and professors. The 90&ndash;person class is a great size; I felt far more connected to people in Hum10, especially my section, than any other class. Also, the HumAlum network was a great resource and place to get to know people in the Hum10 community. Lectures were engaging and always felt like a privilege to watch, and we covered an enormous range of texts. You need to have a love and appreciation for literature, as well as a willingness to read each of the 12 books—otherwise, there&#x27;s no point in taking the course and you should take expos instead. There were many humanities majors, including myself, but also a good mix of STEM and social sciences. We wrote two papers (6 and 8 pages long) and had a final exam, but the assignments were fair and well&ndash;spaced out. If you have a desire to read an incredible selection of great books, take this course for sure.</td>

You get to read a bunch of classic books that, let&#x27;s be honest, you probably wouldn&#x27;t read otherwise. And then, the EXPERT on that book teaches a lecture about it and makes themselves available to you for questions, and then you discuss it with your friends and another professor once a week. THAT&#x27;S SO COOL.  There&#x27;s only two papers all semester (4&ndash;6 pages), so most of the time you spend on this class is the reading itself. A book a week sounds like a lot, but they&#x27;re not throwing Atlas Shrugged at you week after week. I would say on average you&#x27;re reading about 300 pages. The lectures are absurdly good, I&#x27;ve literally cried three separate times and always walk away with a new perspective on the reading. If this sounds enticing, take the class. I&#x27;ve never heard anyone regret taking this course, and you get to sound smart in front of your friends when you start talking about the books you&#x27;ve read.</td>

			<td class="TabularBody_LeftColumn" headers="comment-2_84802497-1dd1-4729-b956-78b787a3028a">This class is very fast&ndash;paced and can feel overwhelming at times, but I 100% recommend taking it. When I was deciding whether or not to take this course, I weighed 3 important factors: (1) I had always wanted to read some of the texts on the syllabus after hearing about them through so many history classes in high school, and I didn&#x27;t know when else I would get the chance to read these texts (2) None of the expos course options particularly excited me and I thought it would be better to spend a year engaging with content that actually excited me rather than a semester with content I was not passionate about (3) I am thinking of being on the pre&ndash;med track, for which I would need 2 semesters of English classes, and this course would fulfill that relatively early on in my college experience (as opposed to doing expos now and another elective later on). Given these factors, I felt that I should take this course and I wanted to share this thinking in hopes that it can help other students when making the decision of whether to enroll in Hum10. You will definitely be spending a LOT of time on this course because you have 3 meeting times for this class (which is significantly more than expos I believe) because the reading is very intensive. So that could be another factor to consider when deciding whether to enroll. I won&#x27;t lie, this class can get out of your hands very quickly &ndash;&ndash; if you miss one book it is very hard to keep going and catch up simultaneously. While it is possible to rely on SparkNotes to know just enough about the texts for lecture and seminar, this will hurt you in the end for the final (which is a pretty intensive exam), and you may feel unfulfilled not having read all the books which were the reason you decided to take this class. Thus, I recommend making a schedule for how much reading you will get done and when (since Lectures are on Tuesday and Seminar Wednesday, view your week as starting on Wednesday and incrementally work through the books until Monday night &#x2F; Tuesday). I feel that because there are no actionable assignments tied to reading, it can become easy to forget &#x2F; overlook until the night before lecture (especially when you have a million other assignments&#x2F;psets&#x2F;deliverables&#x2F;things going on freshman year), thus I think this schedule could be incredibly helpful. The lectures are very cool because you are learning from world&ndash;renowned professors, but they can be a bit broad sometimes and I feel don&#x27;t always do complete justice to the text (which is okay given the fact it is only 75 minutes on some of the most iconic texts in history). However, I feel that the seminars are where the real edification happens. It can be daunting to initially start speaking in seminar, you will probably feel that your thoughts&#x2F;insights&#x2F;ideas are not as profound as everyone else&#x27;s and thus not speak. BUT I promise, everyone else feels the exact same way in the beginning (we all ended up talking about this in the beginning), and the professors&#x2F;TFs are very open to hearing your thoughts &ndash;&ndash; they want to hear you speak so they won&#x27;t judge you negatively for whatever you say (unless it is horribly far off from the text&#x2F;shows you didn&#x27;t read). It&#x27;s always best to give it a shot and raise your hand, share your thoughts and questions and actively engage in both seminar and lab. I have become a much deeper thinker from this, I found that after the first few seminars, I approached the texts differently and began to ask much more acute questions while reading &ndash;&ndash; helping to not only prepare me for the next seminar discussion (and eventually, the final exam) but also extract more meaning from the texts. I have definitely learned how to ask better questions and become a better thinker. At the end of the day, make sure to speak in seminar because (1) you will feel better about actively engaging from the texts &#x2F; getting your questions answered (2) other students may be thinking the same &#x2F; could benefit from your points &#x2F; questions (3) participation MATTERS. To that end, don&#x27;t put too much pressure on yourself to speak either. The paper assignments can be scary, especially since they are worth so much of your grade, but I 100% recommend start planning early, go to your TF office hours, and go to the writing center so that you can plan your writing around when those meeting times are to ensure you are making progress and on track to revise&#x2F;edit&#x2F;flush out all your points in time for  the deadline. I also recommend signing up for a hum10 mentor and asking them for help! One thing I regret is not going to office hours of other profs&#x2F;TFs, it is a rare opportunity to learn from these acclaimed professors, and I wish I went to OH more often. <br/>I hope this information&#x2F;advice is helpful in deciding (1) whether or not to take this course and (2) how to approach this course once you decide to take it (you definitely should!)<br/>I was very apprehensive initially, but I am very glad I took the course and this is all information I wish I knew ahead of time.</td>

The reading load is definitely significant and it can feel like a lot, especially in your first term at Harvard. You will need to spend part of the weekend reading, and the paper assignments will take up significant amounts of time because of the draft&ndash;revision structure. But it is so worth it, and you will almost definitely learn a lot in the course, not only about literature, but about history, life, and lots of other things. I thought the grading for the course was very fair. And you&#x27;ll be learning with classmates and professors who love literature and talking about it as much as you if you&#x27;re a humanities person. You may end up making some really close friends in the class. The professors are absolutely phenomenal, as are the TFs (shoutout to Ian, who provided amazing feedback on our writing and was just an all around great TF). Professor Coleman&#x27;s Aeneid lecture was spellbindingly good, as was Professor Simmons&#x27; Symposium one, and Professor McCarthy&#x27;s one for The Souls of Black Folk. The seminar discussions are very stimulating as well. Although the exam is a bit stressful to prepare for, it is fair and provides a lot of choice. Take this class!

The class is not easy, but it is not difficult either. I would rate it moderate. The readings can be tricky depending on the book, but going to section and listening in lecture will supplement any deficiency you have in your understanding. At the end of the day, the point isn&#x27;t to understand every work perfectly, but to continuously understand it better. Writing is graded extremely fairly, and from my understanding judged similarly to expos.<br/><br/>Even if you aren&#x27;t interested in humanities as a concentration, this is one of the best electives you can take. I&#x27;d encourage you to apply and give it a try. Literature and art in general  is important beyond getting a degree. It shows you a different way to view our world, one that ultimately fosters both empathy and realization. Give it a shot.</td>

I have rarely seen such an acclaimed group of professors teach together &ndash;each professor lectures on two books that they are specialists of. You have the world expert on Shakespeare teaching you Hamlet. For freshmen!<br/>Slight downside, sometimes the lectures aren’t the most engaging: you will get very little out of this class if you don’t read every single book all the way through. Do not count on lectures to suffice for learning &ndash; they only provide general context and some partial analysis.<br/>But, sections are AMAZING. I was in Professor Greenblatt’s 15 person section. We had class in the art Museum, and each week a student was tasked with bringing up from the archives 20 works that fit the themes of the book we were reading that week. I had 2 Picassos come up  for me during my week &ndash; they were right in front of us on the table. What a fantastic experience!</td>

I met really interesting people, both peers, professors, and TFs, through this course, and I would recommend it for someone who wants to explore the Classics, English, and Philosophy departments.</td>

I heard from many of my friends that they wished they had taken it, or that they would have taken it if they could&#x27;ve. It&#x27;s probably one of the only classes that is consistently like that. Hum10 IS challenging &ndash; you read about 200 pages a week, on average, and are expected to discuss it in depth. I made the mistake of finishing the books after lecture, which made me understand them less thoroughly. It&#x27;s also pretty awesome and well worth the challenge. Favorite book was Oedipus or To the Lighthouse.</td>

			<td class="TabularBody_LeftColumn" headers="comment-2_84802497-1dd1-4729-b956-78b787a3028a">This is one of the best courses at Harvard! They want you to succeed &ndash;&ndash; they make you turn in ungraded drafts for feedback, and then you revise and turn in a graded final 2x per term. The final wasn&#x27;t super hard (if you read the books). They have a number of external events like plays or the Boston Symphonic Orchestra that you can attend with the class for free. Your section will become super tight. The HumAlums (who&#x27;ve already taken this class) organize super fun events like Gingerbread house decorating. To put it simply, this class is a community &ndash;&ndash; and truly, if you don&#x27;t take it, you&#x27;ll be missing out on an incredible Harvard experience. Plus my other Gov classes had more reading in sum than this one did. Long live Hum10.</td>
