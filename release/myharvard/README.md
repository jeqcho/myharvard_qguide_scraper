# myHarvard Data Release

The files were scraped using `src/myharvard` in the middle of the previous semester, when course registration opens.

For example, if the file is named `2025_Fall.csv`, then it was scraped during the previous semester of 2025 Spring where the course registration for 2025 Fall had just been opened.
