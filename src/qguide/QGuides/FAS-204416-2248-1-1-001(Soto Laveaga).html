It is so interesting (to the point where you will find yourself actually doing the readings and not just skimming them because the topics are worth giving your full attention to)! The assignments are pretty light (only a few reflection pieces and a final paper). Make sure you go to class though because there might be surprise quizzes (nothing difficult at all it literally only serves as an attendance check), and why wouldn&#x27;t you want to be at lectures they are actually so interesting! This class made me go from MCB to a History of Science concentrator and I could not be more happy with that!! The professor is AMAZING and you can fully tell that she loves what shes doing and what she is teaching! The TF staff are also amazing.

Professor Soto Laveaga&#x27;s lectures were captivating and were told as people centered stories rather than a distant history. The guest lecturers were spectacular, giving us the firsthand perspective on a handful of the assigned readings as well as the exhibition on standardized measurements in the New World. Professor Soto Laveaga and the guest lecturers (especially Mike Wilson) each presented a radically new perspective on the borderlands. The course materials and assigned readings spanned across centuries all the way up to the present day, widely varied on approaches to conceptualizing the border, and were, without fail, incredibly interesting. Assignments were a natural extension of these lecture topics and section discussions and adequate support and time was allowed for each one.</td>

I highly recommend it. The material is SUPER interesting and SUPER relevant. It&#x27;s so important that everyone gets the chance to learn more about what is happening along the US&ndash;Mexico border, because it is so close to us but the experiences of people along the people are so different. Dr. Soto Laveaga is so kind, and her lectures are super engaging. She&#x27;s very passionate about the material, which makes lecture very enjoyable. She&#x27;s really good at storytelling, so you will not get bored. The TFs are awesome too, and the assignments are very interesting (interviewing someone for an oral history project, map assignment, film analysis). Also, a lot of what we learned in class can be applied to other border issues around the world. These issues are very relevant, and this course is a good way to expand your worldview. The workload is pretty manageable, and everything is very intentional &ndash;&ndash; not a lot of busy work. Highly recommend.</td>

The readings can be dense, but they are fairly interesting. The work outside of this class is very light: there is a discussion post each week and a few assignments scattered throughout the course, all of which do not require an extensive amount of time. The course content is interesting and extremely relevant to today&#x27;s world, and Professor Soto Laveaga&#x27;s delivery is so entertaining. Overall, I&#x27;d highly recommend this course.</td>

Make sure you put the assignments into your calendar at the beginning of the year, there&#x27;s a chance your TF won&#x27;t tell you about them until a couple days or the day before it&#x27;s due.  In this vein, ask your TFs about assignments as they&#x27;re coming up, as well as expectations for the assignments as there&#x27;s a chance your TF won&#x27;t mention them. Also, ask your TFs about what the important course themes of the week are, since that&#x27;s mainly what you&#x27;re graded on including in your assignments.</td>

Yet, be prepared for huge amounts of homework. Unnecessary amounts of readings, three papers based on the readings, and a final.  If you are interested in the content, take it, but it’s not a gem.

If you aren&#x27;t invested in the course topics, it won&#x27;t be enjoyable to try and float along. It is a great class if you put in the work.

For the most part, it was just a normal level of work. There was a crazy amount of readings per week which was annoying and they were quite long. Lectures were pretty engaging initially but seemed to run out of content halfway through the semester, they felt like they dragged on a lot and were not as insightful as they were portrayed to seem. My TF was great but some were not and grading was very vague: there were never any rubrics provided beforehand or afterwards and it felt like grades were kind of just given out based on vibes. The assignments themselves, however, were really interesting and I enjoyed doing them and engaging with the class material more than I actually enjoyed the lectures or class itself. Overall though, the workload was not heavy at all, just the right amount I would expect for a GenEd. Attendance was a little bit annoying though so just be prepared to actually be showing up on the dot for the roulette of attendance&ndash;taking methods.</td>

She is an amazing lecturer and always knows how to make the material engaging. I would just be cautious with the section component of the course.<br/><br/>The section component was very bad, and the grading of the assignments often felt arbitrary and completely dependent on the TF. In particular, my TF failed to provide constructive feedback on any of the assignments and never provided a rubric or any sort of guidance on how her comments on the strengths&#x2F;weaknesses of the paper translated into letter grades. It is impossible to improve if this feedback is not present.<br/><br/>I urge the teaching staff to reconsider how the grading is done. I also don&#x27;t expect this to be the same experience for many people since the grades in this class are completely dependent on the TF in charge of the student. I think this is something fundamentally wrong with GENEDS, and in particular, it was a very bad issue for this class. I don&#x27;t expect my grade to change in any way, but, again, I strongly urge and plead with the teaching staff to reconsider how the grading is done. In particular, I urge my TF to be much more transparent when it comes to grading, as right now it is impossible to extract any useful information to improve the quality of future assignments.

Section can be a little dull &ndash; that&#x27;s the thing about learning new stuff all the time, some people won&#x27;t know what to say about it because it&#x27;s so new, so I hope that will be altered so we can understand what we are reading more. I liked that even though this is a history gened, there&#x27;s an entrypoint for people no matter their interest (ie. data, art, poli&ndash;sci, pre&ndash;med).

And we are so lucky to have Prof. Soto Laveaga here teaching us. I unfortunately did not manage time well this semester, so I would sleep in and skip lecture sometimes, but I regret it a lot. Please do not disregard your GENED classes: even from the lectures I did go to, I gleaned so much from the lectures and readings I did do — the history I learned about US and Mexico jointly are things that you cannot just get from reading the news or taking a basic high school history class. And Prof. Soto Laveaga brings in such cool people doing such cool work, so you can&#x27;t miss out on that.<br/><br/>There is a LOT of reading. In the middle of the semester, it is so easy to lose motivation while you&#x27;re grinding out PSETS, reading like 6&ndash;8 hours seems like so much time, if you&#x27;re only taking it to complete GENED requirements. So only sign up for this class if you are ready to sign up for the amount of reading this class calls for. <br/><br/>Sections:<br/>The sections were hit or miss; mine was a miss. You could tell some people did not care that much and people were too busy to be reading for a GENED, but genuinely reading and taking this course seriously would have made discussions so much more fruitful. Additionally, I think it would be so much better if the TAs were people who studied or specialized on the border, and not simply graduate students who study the Humanities. Our discussions were awkward. I felt like I was in my 9th grade English class again. <br/><br/>What I would have done different: <br/>&ndash; Gone to lecture when I was supposed to.<br/>&ndash; Budgeted more time to read.</td>
