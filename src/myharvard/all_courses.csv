Can I know that I am not a brain in a vat being manipulated into thinking that I am an embodied human being? Can I know that the Louisiana Purchase occurred in 1803, that electrons have negative charge, that Hamlet is a masterpiece, that the sun will rise tomorrow?  How can I tell whether a report is ‘fake news’?  Are there ‘alternative facts?’  Is uncertainty regrettable or valuable or both?",,Faculty of Arts & Sciences,4,Not Available for Cross Registration,First Year Seminar Program,Seminar,N/A,FAS Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory,Course open to Freshman Students Only,N/A,N/A,None

Four major themes will be examined. First, the importance of the region in the origin and early development of Western imperialism and capitalism: Why did both Western Europe and America begin their imperial and colonial expansion in this region and to what degree did the region’s slave-based economies influence the nature and development of Western capitalism? Second, what were the consequences of imperialism for the demographic and socio-cultural fate of indigenous and African populations? Is genocide a proper designation of the fate of exploited peoples of the region up to the end of the period of slavery? Third, we examine the post-colonial consequences of this history for the socio-political, economic and cultural development of the region. What have been the main paths toward sustainable development in the modern Caribbean? Why in spite of its long history of engagement with Western capitalism, has the region largely faltered in its efforts to develop? We examine the different paths to development through five case studies—neo-colonial dependency in Puerto Rico, communist dependency in Cuba, democratic socialism in Jamaica, Barbados’ neo-liberal strategy, and aid-dependency in Haiti. We also study the common problem of migration and transnationalism and the degree to which this process undermines national sovereignty. Fourth, we explore the distinctive features of racial classification and cultural representations in the Caribbean. What do we learn about race as a social construction from the Caribbean experience? How do Caribbean racism and colorism unsettle American notions of race and ethnic identities? Why has globalization not led to cultural homogenization? How do we account for the unusual influence of Caribbean music, especially that of Jamaica, on popular global culture?",,Faculty of Arts & Sciences,4,Available for Harvard Cross Registration,General Education,Lecture,N/A,FAS Letter Graded,N/A,"Histories, Societies, Individuals",N/A,None

In doing so, we grapple with the legacy of anthropology’s colonial past to understand questions of power and knowledge production in social anthropological thought. The texts chosen for this course both give insight into the history of the discipline and the wide variety of human (and non-human) existence that anthropologists have written about, with particular attention to pressing ethical questions in contemporary debates in social anthropology. Additionally, the texts chosen represent a variety of writing styles, theoretical approaches, and worldviews that introduce you to the exciting breadth of this ambitious discipline, which strives to give a holistic analysis of what it means to be human.

Students will develop skills within three areas: managing self-awareness for leadership, developing strategic approaches to complex situations, and interpreting meaning. At the heart of each class session will be interactive learning experiences that include case studies, role-play, debating, and team-based interviewing of a wide range of administrators and leaders. Because many HDS MDiv and MTS graduates are contributors to communities that encounter complex problems, students will be taught how to shepherd meaning through shared communal processing. This course teaches students how to develop contextual and communal approaches to leadership and administration as opposed to dictatorial forms of leadership. Students will learn that ethical leadership and moral administration begins with humility, keen listening, compassionate engagement (to self and others as well as to new information), and the interrogation and evaluation of their own moral compasses, values, strengths, and immunities to certain forms of change. This course will pay close attention to the complex layers of communal conflict and/or challenges by distinguishing between technical and adaptive challenges. Students will be taught to attend to what matters most in each situation and how to motivate substantive and sustainable responses to adaptive problems. Additionally, the course also shows leaders how to do more than “solve problems”. It teaches students how to forge a more productive understanding of the human interactions, motivations, and fears that play crucial roles in the development of a community’s capacity for change and courageous action.This is a limited enrollment course.

In addition, the theory and research evidence accumulating in the disciplines of cognitive psychology, neuroscience, and from STEM classrooms, has turned the question of “How do we best teach science and medicine?” into its own scientific discipline. The Theory and Science of Teaching focuses on understanding why certain teaching methods are effective by examining the scientific research and theoretical frameworks that support these methods. We will read and discuss foundational educational and cognitive psychology texts and primary literature, and then develop course materials that allow us to put these ideas into practice.","The course has been designed as a companion to Genetics 302qc: Teaching 101, but neither course is a prerequisite of the other.",Faculty of Arts & Sciences,2,Available for Harvard Cross Registration,Medical Sciences,Lecture,N/A,FAS Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory,N/A,N/A,N/A,None

In the process we will examine the orthodoxy that Keynes attacked and that resurfaced in the 1960s and 70s; the key concepts underlying the models implicit in The General Theory; and the attempts of the Keynesian mainstream to make peace with both Keynes and orthodoxy.

It is about people. It is about those pushed to the margins, whose lives are ground down by poverty, trapped by unjust systems, and devalued by forces that declare some lives worth less than others. This course challenges students to reimagine disease, illness, and injury as biosocial phenomena—shaped as much by poverty, racism, and political violence as by pathogens. From rural Malawi to American prisons, from tuberculosis programs to the overdose crisis, we will trace the roots of global health inequities and examine the ideologies that sustain them.

It is about how we stand alongside the sick and destitute to fight for a future where health is a human right.",,Faculty of Arts & Sciences,4,Available for Harvard Cross Registration,General Education,Lecture,N/A,FAS Letter Graded,N/A,Science and Technology in Society,N/A,None

What can quintessentially operatic figures (the castrato, the prima donna, the doomed lover, the femme fatale) tell us about non-normative identities? And what social, cultural, or political roles can opera fill in the era of global capitalism?  Topics include exoticist and Orientalist tropes and racial costuming; adaptation of European opera across the globe; transgressions of the gender frontier; and hybrid re-interpretations and stagings of works from the operatic canon.

Ec10a introduces students to economic models using intuitive discussions, graphical analysis, and, in some cases, basic algebra. The models study individual decision-making and markets, and range from classical approaches like supply and demand to more recent approaches that consider informational limitations and behavioral mistakes. We will also use data to understand the strengths and weaknesses of these models. The course also discusses the role that ethics and values play in people's choices and in policy discussions, including an understanding and critique of approaches like utilitarianism, Rawlsian principles of justice, and libertarianism. The goal of the course is to provide students with a set of tools that will help them develop answers for themselves on how to make better choices and participate in debates on major public policy issues in areas including tax policy, inequality, discrimination and racial justice, and the environment.","Ec10a is the first half of an integrated sequence that continues with the study of macroeconomics in Ec10b. Students may elect to take only the microeconomics course and receive four credits. This sequence is designed with two types of students in mind. For students who will never take another economics course, Ec10a and Ec10b provide a self-contained training to prepare them to understand and engage with economic issues. For students who end up concentrating in economics, Ec10a and Ec10b provide a wide-ranging introduction to the field and are required courses. The Department of Economics strongly encourages students considering concentrating in economics to take these courses during their first year at the College. Ec10a and Ec10b are not duplicative of AP Economics courses but aim to provide a broader perspective and a deeper engagement with public policy and current developments in the field of economics (e.g., behavioral economics).

By separating the two concepts, Nāgeśa carves out a unique space for Īśvara within a Pāṇinīya's philosophy of language, which otherwise was exclusively dominated by the concepts of Śabdabrahman and sphoṭa.

In this seminar/lecture course, students will learn about transplanting functional human cells (such as pancreatic beta cells or dopaminergic neurons) derived from pluripotent cells to treat disease. They will also discover how to use these cells to model diseases, such as neurodegenerative and cardiovascular diseases, with the goal of identifying more effective, possibly patient-specific, therapeutics. Students will hear about treatments, including small molecules (conventional medicines), whose therapeutic actions can be attributed to the regulation of tissue-specific stem cells that reside in key adult tissues including the bone marrow and brain, but, interestingly, not including the heart or pancreas. Finally, they will be exposed to relatively new work that demonstrates the possibility of creating new cells from old by using genetic methods to swap cell identities. A typical type of question that we will debate is: When should Parkinson’s disease patients be treated with a drug to slow the death of neurons, with transplanted neurons made from pluripotent cells or with a viral vector that produces new neurons from existing glial cells in the brain? This course will highlight the theoretical, as well as the practical, aspects of drug development. How are therapies progressed from conception to patient (bench to bedside)? How can academic investigators commercialize research? Importantly, while this is a science course, not a health economics course, we intend to discuss ways of reducing drug costs. At the same time, we will introduce the new trend of treating rare (even N=1) genetic diseases and how this is or isn’t accommodated within our existing healthcare framework. We believe that students with different backgrounds (biology, chemistry, engineering, business) and at different levels (undergraduate, graduate) can benefit from taking the course and will help enrich the discussions by providing different perspectives on topics that we’ll cover.

For example, when investigating students' outcomes we need to account for the fact that students are nested inside classes that are in turn nested inside schools. If we are watching students develop over time, we need to account for the dependence of measurements across time. If we do not, our inferences will tend to be overly optimistic and wrong. The course provides an overall framework, the multilevel and generalized multilevel (hierarchical) model, for thinking about and analyzing these forms of data. We will focus on specific versions of these tools for the most common forms of longitudinal and clustered data. This course will focus on applied work, using real data sets and the statistical software R. R will be specifically taught and supported. While the primary focus will be on the linear model with continuous outcomes (i.e., the classic regression framework) we will also discuss binary, categorical, and ordinal outcomes. We will emphasize how to think about the applicability of these methods, how they might fail, and what one might do to protect oneself in such circumstances.

Such techniques include principal components analysis (PCA), correspondence analysis (CA), Gifi methods, multidimensional scaling (MDS), and (social) networks.The second half of the class deals with parametric psychometric methods.We start with basic elaborations on measurement and reliability, before moving on to latent variable models. Within this context we cover exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis, and structural equation models which allow us to model complex relationships among (latent) variables. Finally we introduce item response theory, a measurement framework for categorical data.

It has radically altered modes of interpersonal engagement, democratized access to tools of mass communication, and changed the role of gatekeepers that traditionally controlled access to music, video, and other media. Given the breadth of its impact, it is not surprising that the Internet has pushed the bounds of legal doctrines that govern speech, privacy, and the creation and exploitation of content. Mass-scale online distribution of copyrighted works tests the limits of legal doctrines developed in an era of physical copies. Age-old tensions between privacy and the right to free expression have been exacerbated in cases where one’s right to speak bumps up against the desire of another to keep information private. And, the ability to share—and, thus, to consume—extraordinary amounts of personal data has impacted government (which collects and uses data for purposes of law enforcement) and private companies (which collect and use data for purposes of advertising and monetization). This seminar will provide an overview of legal doctrines that govern the online conduct of individuals and institutional actors. It will address the rights and responsibilities of the intermediaries that mediate many of our online activities – social networks, cloud-based storage services, email providers, and the like. Students will consider old and new legal frameworks and the ways in which the law informs strategic decisions for those that operate online. The seminar will address some of the most important and complex policy debates of our day—regarding the proper scope of intellectual property protection; the balance between  a robust environment for online free expression and a desire to protect against harmful speech; and the ways in which the law addresses privacy vis-à-vis both government and private actors.

We will learn about the story of the search for and discovery of a proof of a formula conjectured by Mills-Robbins- Rumsey in the early 1980's: the number of n x n alternating sign matrices. Alternating sign matrices are a curious family of mathematical objects, generalizing permutation matrices, which arise from an algorithm for evaluating determinants discovered by Charles Dodgson (better known as Lewis Carroll). They also have an interpretation as two-dimensional arrangements of water molecules, and are known in statistical physics as square ice. Although it was soon widely believed that the Mills-Robbins-Rumsey conjecture was true, the proof was elusive. Researchers working on this problem made connections to invariant theory, partitions, symmetric functions, and the six-vertex model of statistical mechanics. Finally in 1995, all these ingredients were brought together when Zeilberger and subsequently Kuperberg gave two proofs of the conjecture. In this course we will survey the story of the alternating sign matrix conjecture, building up to Kuperberg's proof.  If time permits, we will also get a glimpse of very recent activity in the field, for example the Razumov-Stroganov conjecture.",,Faculty of Arts & Sciences,4,Not Available for Cross Registration,First Year Seminar Program,Seminar,N/A,FAS Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory,Course open to Freshman Students Only,N/A,N/A,None

What Is Avant-Garde?,FYSEMR   63T,Nariman Skakov,2025 Fall,Full Term,2025-09-02,2025-12-03,3:00pm,5:00pm,Wed,18552,216112,Instructor,0/12,0,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,"Avant-garde art sometimes seems to make a complete break from the art that precedes it. The very name, ‘avant-garde’ (from French, literally ‘advance guard’) carries military connotations that suggest a total, violent break with the past. Our seminar will look at another side of this radical change, asking whether the avant-garde might also be playful, rather than violent, making possible an interplay between invention and convention? And what is the afterlife of the avant-garde? How did its legacy inform aesthetic innovation in a later period? We will try to answer these questions by studying a small set of textual and visual artifacts from the long twentieth century, cutting across different continents and political formations. We will begin with conceptual experiments of the Dada and Suprematist groups and Italian and Russian Futurism and their convoluted relationship with Fascist and Communist ideologies. We contrast these historical examples with later work, like that of Andy Warhol, Nam June Paik, and Joseph Beuys. We will consider cinematic experiments of Dziga Vertov and Jean-Luc Godard, ending with David Lynch’s radical displacement of the reigning ideology of Hollywood in his 2001 masterpiece Mulholland Drive. This nearly century-long framework will allow us to investigate a range of artistic, social, and political mobilizations of the term ‘avant-garde’. We will be doing short readings and working through them together in class, helping students learn how to read theoretical texts as well as read novellas and watch films in the light of theory.","There will be two required trips to the Bauhaus-related collection at the Harvard Art Museums and to the ICA, Boston.",Faculty of Arts & Sciences,4,Not Available for Cross Registration,First Year Seminar Program,Seminar,N/A,FAS Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory,N/A,N/A,N/A,None

Technology has left us with mere facsimiles of nature - pixilated abstractions of biodiversity through satellite imagery, decoded strings of DNA – and we, as a species, have become fundamentally disconnected from actual nature and the magnificent organisms with which we share the earth. In this seminar, we will work to understand and give agency to trees as individual organisms, literally rooted in the ground, and evolutionarily rooted in deep time. Topics to be covered include the evolutionary origin of arborescence, human relationships with non-sentient organisms, the case for legal rights for natural objects, reading a twig, the unseen world of roots, and finding human meaning in the longevity in trees. Each student will also work with an individual tree in the living collections of the Arnold Arboretum of Harvard University and observe (see) this organism throughout the entire semester through the creation of images (photography, drawing), journaling, and other forms of representation.

Stuck in a frustrating period of “waithood” or waiting for adulthood, urban youths in Africa are increasingly devising enterprising ways to improvise their livelihoods and assert their right to the city. One creative way in which youths are responding to everyday uncertainty and frustrations is through the power of pop culture, which includes creating new artistic, musical, performance, and fashion forms that extend across and beyond African cities. Consider, for example, the cross-cultural power and global appeal of Afrobeats. Notable American musicians, from Beyoncé to Pharrell Williams and Chris Brown, are fast integrating African pop music into their sounds as part of the upward trend of the “Afro-Cool” in the United States. This, of course, raises important questions about the boundaries between what is cultural appreciation and what is cultural appropriation.  In this seminar, we ask: In the face of the contradictions of modern city life in Africa, in which people’s opportunities and expectations are simultaneously broadened and constrained, how do young people fashion new ways of being and interacting with society? In what ways can crisis become opportunity? To address these questions, we will watch films, listen critically to music, analyze written texts, take virtual tours, and visualize fashion and popular art forms that shed new light on the “hustle economy” in urban Africa, its relationship with pop culture in American cities, and the innovative ways in which young people are making their voices heard in the city.",,Faculty of Arts & Sciences,4,Not Available for Cross Registration,First Year Seminar Program,Seminar,N/A,FAS Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory,Course open to Freshman Students Only,N/A,N/A,None

This disparity between law-on-the-books and law-in-action has prompted social-legal scholars to closely examine the latter.This course adopts a law-in-action approach to explore the intricate relationship between law and society. We will explore major theoretical perspectives and empirical studies that analyze the dynamics between law, legal institutions, and their social, political, economic, and cultural contexts.

(More than half of CS50 students have never taken CS before!) This course teaches you how to solve problems, both with and without code, with an emphasis on correctness, design, and style. Topics include computational thinking, abstraction, algorithms, data structures, and computer science more generally. Problem sets inspired by the arts, humanities, social sciences, and sciences. More than teach you how to program in one language, this course teaches you how to program fundamentally and how to teach yourself new languages ultimately. The course starts with a traditional but omnipresent language called C that underlies today's newer languages, via which you'll learn not only about functions, variables, conditionals, loops, and more, but also about how computers themselves work underneath the hood, memory and all. The course then transitions to Python, a higher-level language that you'll understand all the more because of C. Toward term's end, the course introduces SQL, via which you can store data in databases, along with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, via which you can create web and mobile apps alike. Course culminates in a final project. See https://cs50.harvard.edu/college for advice, FAQs, syllabus, and what's new. Email the course's heads at heads@cs50.harvard.edu with questions.","This course ordinarily meets for lectures in Sanders Theatre on Mondays, 1:30pm–4:15pm, but the course's first lecture will be in Sanders Theatre on Wednesday, September 3, 1:30pm–4:15pm. Students are expected to attend the course's lectures in person unless simultaneously enrolled in another course that meets at the same or an overlapping time, in which case they may watch CS50's lectures online and attend the other course in person. (The Ad Board has already granted this exception for CS50; no other steps are required.) If you have other academic or athletic conflicts, submit cs50.harvard.edu/simultaneous. Course also includes a weekly discussion section, to be arranged. CS50 is ordinarily graded SAT/UNS, though students whose concentration requires letter grades should change their grading status to letter-graded by the term’s eleventh Monday. Students may take CS50 SAT/UNS to fulfill the Science and Engineering and Applied Science distribution requirement or the Quantitative Reasoning with Data requirement, but not both. First years may take both CS50 and a first-year seminar SAT/UNS.

How might the study of the New Testament's social and historical context relate to its ongoing role as sacred and/or authoritative in the Christian tradition? And what are some of the diverse ways that contemporary readers bridge the gap between the New Testament's ancient Greco-Roman context and their own interpretation and application? We will explore these questions through careful study of the New Testament texts themselves, while also attending to issues of historical context, methodology, and hermeneutics. No previous study in religion or ancient history is assumed, and there are no prerequisites for enrolling in the course.

How are we to think about the strong emotions they evoke and learn to resist as well as appreciate their power? This course revisits Geoffrey Chaucer's classic fourteenth-century poem, The Canterbury Tales: the deepest and most caustically entertaining analysis of storytelling ever written. The Canterbury Tales consists of a series of tales told by members of a pilgrimage on their way from London to Canterbury, representatives of the internally divided social world of Chaucer’s England. Some are serious, others funny, obscene, or offensive; some are religious, others not at all; some deal with issues local to England, others range across the Europe and the rest of the known world; many are told against other pilgrims. Written in a long-ago past, the poem jumps off the page, in turns unrecognisably weird and startlingly modern. We read the poem in the language in which it was written, Middle English, easy and fun to learn with early help: no previous experience with the language, or with the medieval era, is necessary. We will also explore the poem's long-ranging impact on English literature, including several contemporary reimaginings. Classes include a short lecture on a tale, and class discussion, which continues in weekly sections. Course projects include an essay, a collaborative report on one tale, and a creative option. Students of all years and from all concentrations and programs are welcome.

This seminar is a support of independent thesis and/or independent project research, extending methodological inquiry of the project topic to design where students may convene to collectively discuss and experiment with design speculations – design tests that explore research through the visual and spatial language of architecture. The course will cover topics general to design research with discussions, assignments, and readings focused on three main themes in relation to architectural design: Discourse, the development of a proposition for the role and significance of architecture relative to the project topic of interest; Method, the design steps/process of working through a design application/inquiry of those ideas; and Context, the relationship of the project topic of study to broader surroundings which include but are not limited to the discipline of architecture, cultural contexts, technical developments and/or typologies. The seminar will emphasize and support the translation of ideas emerging from independent research into visual forms of representation including, but not limited to, drawings, diagrams, images, study models, and shortanimations.

In this course, we will explore the Buddhist view of compassion and will draw on traditional texts, contemplative approaches, and applied contemporary methods in counseling, social engagement and clinical practice based in compassion theory to consider skillful means in compassionate care. Consideration will also be given to the process of relational compassion (“intersubjectivity”) in direct clinical care, as well as its place in Buddhist ethics, as well as scientific research into brain physiology, neuroplasticity, and the effects of compassion-based meditation.

In this course we’ll look at recent Latin American literature that establishes a sometimes productive, other times disruptive relationship with archives and criticism, in contrast to previous works that have delved into the archives for their literary production. Delving into the pressures and challenges faced by contemporary Latin American authors such as Jazmina Barrera, Mariana Enriquez, Fernando Vallejo, among others, as they navigate the dual demands of producing literature that is both critically relevant and culturally resonant, amidst the backdrop of archival extractivism and a fast-evolving literary landscape, the course will offer a panoramic approximation to how intertwined literary production and literary criticism can be, and the consequences this has on both the literary field and academia. The combined concepts of critical obsolescence and archival mining aim to explore how these forces impact the creation, reception, and interpretation of literature in Latin America. Authors seem to find themselves negotiating between the vast historical and cultural tapestries available through the regions’ archives and the demands for fresh, relevant narratives in a global literary market. This places a particular type of pressure on authors and critics in Latin America to continuously innovate or react to new developments, which can render previous interpretations quickly obsolete, but that also assume certain tightness in regard to the possibilities of the hermeneutical process itself.",,Faculty of Arts & Sciences,4,Available for Harvard Cross Registration,Romance Languages & Lit,Seminar,N/A,FAS Letter Graded,N/A,N/A,N/A,Arts and Humanities

To solve these problems, technical execution is not enough—we need true conceptual breakthroughs. Examples include reconciling quantum mechanics with gravity or finding the biological mechanisms that cause mental illness.A key part of the seminar is identifying a GHP that deeply interests you. Each week will feature Harvard faculty whose research is related to these GHPs. Maybe it's the origin of life, dark matter and the structure of the universe, or cracking the code of human aging. They will make a pitch to serve as your academic mentor, and together, you'll plan an undergraduate curriculum focused on building the skills and knowledge you'd need to tackle your chosen GHP. You'll also study historical cases where seemingly impossible problems were solved, often by young researchers with fresh perspectives.By the end of the seminar, you'll have a clearer picture of the scientific landscape and where you might fit into it. We hope that some of you will embark on a tailored academic journey here at Harvard, aimed at equipping you to address some of science's most profound mysteries.

Ever wonder why play is so important for growing minds and how it shapes the way children learn, connect, and navigate the world? This course explores how play drives social, emotional, and cognitive development across childhood, using insights from developmental psychology, neuroscience, and clinical research. From the imaginative worlds of toddlers to the structured games of older children, students will examine how play builds essential skills like problem-solving, self-regulation, and social bonding. The course also addresses the neurobiological underpinnings of play, such as its role in stress regulation and neural plasticity, and explores its applications in fostering resilience and addressing developmental challenges. Students will investigate how disruptions to play—due to socioeconomic, environmental, or neurodevelopmental factors—affect overall development, while also considering how cultural contexts shape play experiences and inform inclusive, equitable practices. Students will also have opportunities to observe and analyze children’s play behaviors in everyday settings, such as children’s museums or daycares.

How can we make sense of the archive in a way that counters historical silences? And how might oral histories fill in gaps left by archival negations? This course introduces students to theories, practices and controversies of the archive and oral history methodologies, with the goal of creating what the scholar Marianne Hirsch calls “countermemories,” representations of the past that unearth ignored or disruptive material. Readings include interdisciplinary writing by feminist, anti-racist, and anti-colonial scholars demonstrating a range of approaches, as well as primary sources like historical documents and novels that incorporate archival materials to reimagine the past, present, and future. We will also work with Schlesinger Library’s archival collections, community-based archives and digitized oral histories, and practice oral history interviews of our own.

During the 17th century, Amsterdam rapidly transformed into Europe’s global trading hub and political powerhouse of the emerging Dutch Republic. It nurtured some of the period's greatest luminaries, including Rembrandt, Descartes and Spinoza. Long celebrated for its religious tolerance, artistic innovation and economic modernity, Amsterdam’s golden age also became notorious for its involvement with slave trade and military repression in Asia, Africa, and the Americas. This course seeks to probe these ambiguous characteristics of the city and to identify their possible interconnections. For this purpose, we will assess a variety of written and visual source material, including pamphlets, diaries and travel accounts as well as prints, paintings and material objects. These sources will enable students to gain a deeper understanding of early modern urban culture and to consider the use of visual evidence in historical scholarship. Classes on civic republicanism, religious diversity, and global migrations will alternate with sessions on the home, consumption, and gender. The course will make extensive use of the rich Dutch art collections of the Harvard Art Museums and Boston’s Museum of Fine Arts.","This course meets the ""Beyond North America"" History Concentration requirement.",Faculty of Arts & Sciences,4,Available for Harvard Cross Registration,History,Seminar,N/A,FAS Letter Graded,N/A,N/A,N/A,Social Sciences

Though lesser known than its American, French or Industrial counterparts, the mass exodus of willing (and unwilling) migrants in the wake of the Napoleonic Wars was no less revolutionary in its impact. The formidable scale, unprecedented reach and dogged persistence of this global phenomenon are by no means self-explanatory. Fundamental to making sense of ‘settlerism’ is the concept of global modernity – that potent mix of technological innovation, economic dynamism, hypermobility and destructive physical force that transformed the nineteenth-century world.

This course pursues two guiding questions: how has anxiety changed throughout history and how has it stayed the same? And how have authors throughout history productively channeled anxiety into creating beautiful and meaningful works of art? Through a combination of readings and fieldwork, we’ll investigate anxiety’s potential causes, from the universal fear of death to the more historical contexts of urbanization and self-optimization, for instance, as well as its various treatments, such as stoicism, self-help, and psychopharmacology. The course combines practical and theoretical perspectives to examine the relation between anxiety and creativity and to engage with various aesthetic responses—from comedy to literature and film—to the troubles of being that anxiety designates. Smaller weekly assignments will include slow reading, technological unplugging, and proposing one improvement to the mental health culture on campus.

Indeed large scale, irregular human migration should be considered “the new normal”, not an unexpected or one-off “crisis”.   It affects the lives of millions, unsettles established governments, creates sharply polarizing policy dilemmas and generates far-reaching administrative, economic and political challenges.  This course will focus on distress migration, including refugee flight and other forms of forced displacement, evaluated through the lens of human rights.  It will address the multifaceted drivers of the phenomenon, including the enduring legacies of colonization, armed conflict, environmental stress and climate change, global inequality, demographic pressures and increasing globalization. The course will also consider the impact of government responses to the COVID 19 pandemic on forced migrants.  Migration actors from UN agencies, NGOs and other civil society organizations, and research experts working in a range of field sites will contribute to the class.The course will address the legal frameworks governing migration, and the ethical and pragmatic considerations that influence policies. It will explore the viability of a range of solutions to current migration challenges, including unequal access to protection, the failure of equitable resettlement and the erosion of host empathy/solidarity.  The extent to which pandemic related measures conform to or violate legal and ethical obligations will also be considered.  A key goal is to enable students to analyze current migration situations with clarity and rigor concerning the obligations of states and the rights of migrants. Using examples of large-scale contemporary population movements – the Ukrainian war and its human impact, the ongoing Tigrayan emergency, the Rohingya exodus, the Venezuelan context, the Mediterranean migration situation, extensive intra-regional mobility within the African continent, US/Mexico/Central American movements, unaccompanied child migration in many regions – the course will examine migration drivers, policy responses and rights challenges such as exclusion and denial of protection, persistent racism in border control, detention, prolonged confinement within refugee camps and forced repatriation. It will also engage with the multiple risks, including statelessness, trafficking, drowning, sexual violence, that migrants face before, during and after their journeys. The course will cover key current policy developments, at the municipal, national, regional and international level. The course will discuss seasonal migration, child migration, undocumented and irregular status, gender factors in migration and the role of xenophobia in driving policy. Students will be required to make in class presentations, to prepare questions for guest lecturers, and to participate in class discussion, including by considering a range of strategies for increasing access to safe mobility as a key redistributive global good.Undergraduate enrollment is limited to juniors and seniors.",,Faculty of Arts & Sciences,4,Available for Harvard Cross Registration,"Ethnicity, Migration, Rights",Lecture,N/A,FAS Letter Graded,N/A,N/A,N/A,Arts and Humanities

The size and shape of the face has changed dramatically across human evolution. Some of our prehistoric relatives had huge teeth and enormous cheek bones, others had massive brow ridges, and modern humans have unique features such as our chins and our unusually big, globular brains. This course will explore how our social interactions and facial expressions, changes in what we eat and how we eat it, and evolutionary adaptations (sexual selection and cultural/environment influences) have molded the face and led to the variety of facial forms we see within and between populations today. We will examine the origins of human facial variation from our early primate origins, across the hominin fossil record, to the impact of modern soft diets and dentistry. What do we think the last common ancestor of humans and chimpanzees looked like? What were the earliest changes to the face and what can they tell us about the lives of our ancestors? What can our own faces tell us about our ancestry, development, and health?",,Faculty of Arts & Sciences,4,Available for Harvard Cross Registration,Human Evolutionary Biology,Seminar,N/A,FAS Letter Graded,N/A,N/A,N/A,Science & Engineering & Applied Science

Rejecting artistic boundaries, ASCO transformed drawing into an act of resistance, using murals and graffiti, printmaking, photography, performance, and installation to reclaim space and disrupt dominant narratives. This course takes ASCO’s radical defiance as a starting point for an interdisciplinary exploration of drawing as both a visual and conceptual practice. While ASCO’s legacy is central, we will also examine the broader Chicano art movement, its key figures, and its ongoing influence on contemporary artistic and activist practices. Expanding traditional notions of mark-making, we will investigate drawing’s role in activism, public engagement, and self-representation through experimental approaches including collage, ephemeral media, and performative gestures. Open to students of all disciplines and experience levels, this course encourages risk-taking, critical engagement, and a reimagining of drawing’s possibilities in contemporary discourse. The instructor of this course is Maria Gamboa. Crosslisting: AFVS 13",,Faculty of Arts & Sciences,4,Available for Harvard Cross Registration,"Ethnicity, Migration, Rights",Studio,N/A,FAS Letter Graded,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A

Students will gain insight into the cultural, economic, and religious practices that shaped Morisco identity during this transformative period. The course will examine the challenges faced by the Moriscos in preserving their cultural and religious identity while living in a predominantly Christian society. The expulsion of the Moriscos from Spain in 1609 represents a pivotal moment in their history, and this course will provide an in-depth analysis of its causes, consequences, and global impact. The Diaspora section will examine the migration of the Moriscos beyond Spain's borders, with a particular focus on their settlement in North Africa. Using an interdisciplinary approach, students will examine the Moriscos' contributions to art, literature, science, and philosophy in their new environment, as well as the challenges they faced in maintaining their distinct identity. Students will engage with scholarly articles and contemporary accounts to develop a nuanced understanding of the historical trajectory of the Moriscos.

Genes provide the basic blueprint for brain architecture, but experiences shape the activity of the genome and thus determine how the circuitry is wired. Significant adversity can derail developmental processes and distort brain maturation, leading to limited economic and social mobility. Exposure to significant adversity early in life, particularly during critical periods of brain development, may increase risk for a host of chronic physical health problems, including cardiovascular disease, hypertension, diabetes, and addictive behavior; it can also lead to a variety of mental health problems, including depression and anxiety and characterological problems. Science clearly indicates that the longer we wait to intervene on behalf of such children, the more difficult it becomes to achieve healthy outcomes. This constraint is particularly true for children who sustain the wear and tear of early exposure to so‐called “toxic stress”. In this seminar we will critically examine the range of adverse early experiences that impact children growing up in both low and high resource countries. Key themes include a) the nature of the adversity children are exposed to, b) the timing of the adversity c) the chronicity of the adversity, and d) individual differences (including genetic and environmental factors that may confer protection on children exposed to early adversity).

In fact, recent history suggests things are typically much more complicated: negotiations between the disputants commonly play a critical role in ending armed conflict. One only must consider Korea, Vietnam, Bosnia, Afghanistan, and Iraq.This seminar will initially introduce students to some core ideas relating to negotiation and bargaining theory. Through readings, we will then explore how several wars in fact evolved. We will ask why did the war begin, and did the disputants first attempt to avoid armed conflict through negotiations? To what extent, if any, did negotiations between the combatants end the fighting? We will see that while the expectations and aims of the combatants are typically deeply opposed at the beginning of a war, over time they often converge toward an agreement to stop fighting. In such cases, what produces this convergence? To what extent do factors far removed from the battlefield - economic, political, and social – contribute to the success of negotiations?In addition to readings, students will engage in a few negotiations related exercises and simulations in class.",,Faculty of Arts & Sciences,4,Not Available for Cross Registration,First Year Seminar Program,First Year Seminar,N/A,FAS Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory,N/A,N/A,N/A,None

Humanity’s seemingly boundless appetite for energy has also remade global climate. This course tracks the development of modern energy history from the advent of age of coal to the present day, with special attention to the intersections between social change and energy systems. Our primary focus will be on the emergence of what some scholars call “fossil fuel civilization”; its costs, benefits, and prospects. Our approach is historical rather than economic or technical. We will read primary documents, place today’s news in context, and craft our own narratives of historical change. This is an introductory course to a big topic.

It is meant to introduce students to ways of life that are informed by the most prominent sub-traditions of Hinduism today as they are reflected in the different versions of the Hindu calendar, also called Pañcāṅga or Pañjikā. Building on the history of different Hindu calendars, which consist of lunar dates (tithis), this course aims to give a broad overview of Hindu religious life as it revolves around festivals, fasts, seasonal rituals and pilgrimages that comprise each version of the calendar. Students will begin this journey with the Lunar New Year of the Vikrama Saṁvat calendar, which coincides with the end of the Spring Festival of Nine Nights (Caitra Navarātri) dedicated to the feminine divine, Śakti. After exploring the many ways in which the same event is celebrated in different regions, students will progress through the calendar towards the end of the year, learning about other major Hindu festivals along the way. Because of the diversity of religious perspectives in the sub-traditions of Hinduism, often the same events on these lunar calendars are imbued with multiple meanings and celebrated in various ways, so this course will put a special emphasis on learning when and how religious events are tied to entirely different mythologies and theologies, and how that creates opportunities for pluralistic encounters. Furthermore, since not all traditions under the umbrella of ‘Hinduism’ agree on one New Year or one supreme deity, the course also delves into alternative New Year celebrations, the deities and mythologies honored by them, and the issues of caste reflected by them. Throughout the course, students will learn about the ways in which devotees structure their lives around sacred dates, such as the birthdays and anniversaries of their chosen deities of worship, as well as commemorations of other mythological events. In addition to this, they will gain a perspective on food, visual art, dance, and music as aspects of life regulated by the Hindu calendar. Finally, the course will highlight cross-religious experiences, as certain major festivals transcend religious boundaries and share a history with some non-Hindu festivals that coincide with them.

We will analyze the texts’ genre structures and aesthetic devices, as well as situate them in a broader set of literary conversations and traditions. Throughout the course, we will discuss the political stakes of the literary texts we read. We will see the works operate in many ways: for instance, they may build power and resistance, bear witness to the brutalization of Indigenous peoples, or uphold narratives of Indigenous erasure. Land is constantly present in the texts as a position of enunciation, a site of struggle, and a topic of reflection.

Leaving aside such facile comparisons and analogies, this course offers an in-depth case study of Germany's path from a democracy full of promise and possibility to that democracy's collapse into tyranny, war, and the Holocaust. We will work extensively with primary sources including contemporary eye witness accounts, political and economic commentary, art, and literature to explore the rise of National Socialism in the context of the politics, culture, and economics of Germany after the First World War before turning to the way the Nazis managed to seize the state, remake German society after 1933, and plunge Europe into war and genocide by the end of the decade.

The transition from adolescence to adulthood is often fraught with anxieties about realizing one’s dreams, getting into college, succeeding in the job market, and finding a life partner. Have the definitions and markers of adulthood changed across generations?  Should these conceptualizations change or adapt to the times? Are young people today trapped in an extended adolescence? Some experts and the popular press contend that young people today are coddled and more resistant to growing up than were those who came of age a generation or more ago. Conversely, other experts and many young adults today find that growing up is harder—harder to launch a career, burdened by student loan debt, harder to find a compatible life partner—in general, harder to achieve the life their parents have. Amid these debates, it is unclear what is meant by adulthood and whether it can or should be defined by the same markers as have been used in the past.  Today’s young adults are charting their own path…or are they? In this seminar, students will define and redefine adulthood based in multiple contexts, considering catalysts and impediments on the pathway to adulthood. Using a historical lens, we will examine and understand the contexts that elicit longer and shorter pathways to adulthood, including the role of the economic context, educational and occupational opportunities, gender, and the need to co-construct adulthood with others.  Whereas societal factors are often considered contextual, this seminar focuses on societies as active agents in shaping adolescents’ beliefs about adulthood and struggling with and sometimes against adolescents as they navigate their place as adults. This seminar takes a global lens and focuses on the ways in which the transition to adulthood is a dynamic and co-constructed concept and will aid students in developing an integrative understanding on societal needs and pressures and young adults’ tools in navigating the path to adulthood.",,Faculty of Arts & Sciences,4,Not Available for Cross Registration,First Year Seminar Program,Seminar,N/A,FAS Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory,N/A,N/A,N/A,None

But, as historian Martha S. Jones (and many others) has shown, Black women have always been at the “vanguard” of affecting positive change in American society. This course sets out to look back to the 20th century to examine conditions under which Black women lived in the early days of Jim Crow and the role that Black women and non-binary people have played in shaping politics, grassroots organizing, the legal bar, and higher education during Jim (Jane) Crow and beyond. Through the archive and the personal papers of Pauli Murray, June Jordan, Angela Davis, and Flo Kennedy, we will see the human side of these themes and the Black Freedom Struggle. What did life look like for Black women during the Nadir? How did these people navigate gender and sexuality while pushing for civil rights? How did gender, sexuality, and intersectionality impact their political ideologies?Though many scholars argue that the law is autonomous, Critical Legal Studies scholars and Critical Race theorists argue that the law is subjective. In “Race, Gender, and the Law through the Archive,” students will see the subjectivity of the Black women and non-binary people who helped push for social and legal reform. Some of these women/people shaped the law as attorneys (Pauli Murray and Flo Kennedy). In contrast, others shaped the law and visions of freedom through their activism (Murray, Kennedy, Angela Y. Davis, and June Jordan), teaching (Davis), and art (Jordan). Through their avenues of influence, all of these women/people, whose papers are housed at Harvard’s Schlesinger Library, wielded the law or helped shape it in the twentieth century.","This course meets the ""North America"" History Concentration requirement.

What kinds of inequalities should we care about? And, given what we know about inequality today, what should we demand that people and governments do about them?

Later, in an interview with Professor Carrasco, Morrison stated, “When I read his book One Hundred Years of Solitude, I literally said, “Oh, my God, you can do this”—meaning magic, strange stuff—and be deadly serious. So, that freed me up in my writing. Reading him unlocked something important for me. ”This course is a comparative and critical study of the religious dimensions in their writings and lives with special attention to the themes of religious experience, homeland and quests, Africa and Latin America, ""rememory"" and myths, goodness and the literary imagination.

Neuroimaging and Big Data in Connectomics: Advances in Understanding the Wiring of the Brain,MBB  980V,Lisa Nickerson,2025 Fall,Full Term,2025-09-02,2025-12-03,3:00pm,5:00pm,Tue,15575,215757,Instructor,0/15,0,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,"Constructing a map of the connections between the 86 billion neurons in the human brain has been a goal of neuroscience since the field originated. Connectomics research, which aims to understand how the brain is wired together into this map, has shown the human brain to be a complex network with the same properties that other complex networks exhibit. Much like our social networks, the world wide web, and our travel systems, the brain demonstrates organization along similar principles as these networks and can be studied using techniques adapted from network science. Using this ""network neuroscience"" approach has shown that the brain's gray matter is organized into a functional connectome comprised of modules called brain networks that orchestrate their functions to support our everyday activities. More recently, advances in another MRI technique called diffusion MRI have made it possible to study the organization of the brain’s white matter ""information highways"", or structural connectome, that transmit information from brain region-to-brain region, brain network-to-brain network. MRI-based connectomics is a rapidly growing field, with new methods and applications evolving at an incredibly fast pace and there are now numerous large-scale neuroimaging initiatives across the world that are aimed at mapping the human brain connectome. These studies aim to map the human brain connectome across the lifespan, from in utero to the oldest old, and in brain disorders such as mental illnesses, developmental disorders, neurological disorders and other health conditions. The goal of this class is to understand how MRI can be used to study the living human brain connectome and the latest advances these approaches have revealed in our understanding of the wiring of the brain. We will also dive into some of the large-scale neuroimaging datasets to see how we can leverage these open access resources for connectomics research. This course is designed for students in the MBB programs who are interested in learning about how we study brain connectivity and how the brain is organized, including those who are interested in neuroscience applications and brain disorders and those interested in bioinformatics/computer science/statistics/physics applications in neuroimaging. To unlock the “black box” nature of the sophisticated MRI methods used for connectomics research, we will learn the basics of the workhorse MRI connectomics methods, functional and diffusion MRI, from a conceptual perspective. We will learn how each of these techniques is used for connectomics studies and some key methodological and interpretational issues for each. Then we will focus on the brain’s connectome. We will discuss brain organization, including how to construct a brain graph as the mathematical embodiment of the brain’s connectome and how to evaluate the brain’s network properties using graph theory and other approaches, the brain networks that have been reported in the literature, and the links between structural and functional connectomes. We will do a survey of widely used open access tools for connectivity and connectome analyses, and open access connectome datasets with sample sizes of hundreds up to a hundred thousand, including the Human Connectome Lifespan and Disease Connectome studies, the ABCD study, and the UK Biobank. These datasets will also be used as hypothetical data sources for your final research projects.

The goal of this course is twofold: first, to familiarize the students with the variety of attested reading traditions and, second, to introduce them to the periodization of Biblical Hebrew. In each case we will read portions of texts to better grasp the main linguistic differences between reading traditions and between chronolects, and to understand the interpretative implications of such differences. We will begin with a detailed and advanced study of the Tiberian reading tradition, whose basic features the students already know. We will then explore the less known, yet prestigious, Babylonian reading tradition, which we will compare to the more familiar Tiberian one. Finally, the students will be introduced to the so-called popular reading traditions, that is the Palestinian reading tradition and the transliterations of portions of texts and words of the Hebrew Bible into Greek (e.g., Origen’s Secunda and those found in the Septuagint) and into Latin (e.g., Jerome). To conclude our study of reading traditions, we will study the Samaritan reading tradition and read portions of the Samaritan Pentateuch. With regards to periodization and linguistic diachrony, the students will be introduced to the distinctive features (mostly syntactic and semantic) of the three main chronolects of Biblical Hebrew and their respective textual corpora: Classical Biblical Hebrew (pre-exilic); Transitional Biblical Hebrew (exilic); Late Biblical Hebrew (post-exilic).

Equally unprecedented was the sensitivity of late medieval literary writers to these events. Far from serving as mouthpieces to the powerful or entertainers who distract from reality, the literary community spoke out, whether by constructing alternativenarratives, meditating on experiences of fragility and trauma, exposing hidden inequities that target the most vulnerable, or cultivating cultures of care. What can the literature of this period tell us about what it means to be vulnerable? Or what it means to encounter vulnerability with care? Can the intimate activities of writing and reading become a means of expressing, exposing, soliciting, enacting, or provoking such encounters? In this course we will explore these questionsthrough selected works of poetry, prose, music, manuscript documentary evidence, and modern criticism to discover a shared commitment among late medieval literary writers to challenge dominant discourses of power and resiliency, asserting the value of different forms of vulnerability and calling for urgently needed ethics and politics of care.",,Faculty of Arts & Sciences,4,Available for Harvard Cross Registration,Romance Languages & Lit,Seminar,N/A,FAS Letter Graded,N/A,N/A,N/A,Arts and Humanities

In this semester, we will emphasize conceptual mastery of and computational fluency with the critical ideas of differential calculus. There will be required workshops twice weekly on Tuesdays and Thursdays, which focus on additional practice and core skills important for the course's content. This course is appropriate for students with and without calculus experience. Techniques from high school algebra are used right away and students who have taken a break from mathematics can expect to spend extra time reviewing them.","Note: This course is taught in small sections that run at different times throughout the day on a Monday/Wednesday/Friday schedule (MWF) with a twice weekly workshop on Tuesdays and Thursdays.  Math Ma5 students will attend a Math Ma section MWF.  Math Ma is taught in small sections throughout the day on a Monday/Wednesday/Friday schedule (9:00-10:15 am, 10:30-11:45 am, 12-1:15 pm, 1:30-2:45 pm, and 3:00-4:15 pm with sufficient enrollment).  Completing your registration for Math Ma5 is a two-step process: first, you'll enroll in the course within my.harvard, and then, you'll fill out the Math Sectioning form in your my.harvard To-Do list to submit your time preferences. Please submit time preferences before 5pm on Tuesday, September 2. Note this To-Do list may take up to 15 minutes to appear after enrolling. If your time preferences change, you may submit the form again; only your latest submission will be used. At a later date, you'll be asked to sign up for your Tuesday/Thursday workshop.  NEW for 2025-2026: All students planning on enrolling in any mathematics course (Math Ma through Math 21b) for the 2025-2026 academic year are required to sit a skills check on Tuesday, September 2, in order to offer accurate course selection information beyond the June placement exam recommendation.  Please see the course website for more information and logistics.  After Math Ma5, students may take Math Mb (just like Math Ma students). Math Ma5 and Math Mb, can then be followed by Mathematics 1b. Mathematics Ma5 and Mb together cover all the material in Mathematics 1a (and more).",Faculty of Arts & Sciences,4,Available for Harvard Cross Registration,Mathematics,Lecture,N/A,FAS Letter Graded,N/A,N/A,N/A,Science & Engineering & Applied Science

How does database design impact how we buy and sell things? How is wood sourced and processed for the construction of housing stock? What might a bridge do besides facilitate a crossing? Each of these aspects of infrastructure can exert their influence at multiple scales and in multiple ways, often anchoring diverse landscapes of experience across populations, communities, and individuals. In this course, we will explore how the infrastructures that organize social life are formed, experienced, and interpreted as the “things and also the relations between things” (Larkin 2013) that give shape to gender, race, caste, colonialism, imperialism, commerce, environment, government, protest, and abolition. In turn, we will explore how the study of infrastructure offers a unique perspective for theorizing the “social” in social theory and how imaginations of what is “necessary” for social life mediate the demands we make on theory and our own research. Materials for the course will draw on a broad corpus of readings, films, television shows, games, and technical documents across the disciplines of anthropology, sociology, history, visual studies, media studies, and science and technology studies.

This course explores these ideas, their development, and the interplay between them and political and economic growth. Where do these ideas come from, and how do they change over time? What happens when they clash with social or political reality? What are the benefits and drawbacks of focusing our attention on the realm of culture? As we work to answer these questions, we’ll also address the methods of settler colonial theory, environmental history, and literary history. Our discussions will move between ideas about the land, geology, and environmental damage and ideas about people, cities, and technology, as we seek to understand how deeply interrelated these various aspects of the American West are.",,Faculty of Arts & Sciences,4,Available for Harvard Cross Registration,History & Literature,Seminar,N/A,FAS Letter Graded,N/A,N/A,N/A,Arts and Humanities

We will delve deeply into genres of arts practices that could help you to imagine a way forward in your own work. In doing so, the goal is to advance your transition into a professional life in theater, dance, and media, and the identify your key concerns (both artistic and pragmatic) regarding a professional practice. Throughout the semester we will discuss how your personal goals and concerns intersect with political, social, and individual contemporary preoccupations in those fields.  This junior tutorial is designed to organize participants into a community of singular artist interlocutors who can also supportively engage with one another’s projects. You will develop methods to articulate your own intentions and impulses with great specificity, offer appropriate feedback for the stage of development for your peer’s projects, and acquire facility with terms of art in theater, dance & media.  Our semester is oriented to gaining autonomy and independence in relation to your interests. For the first seven weeks of the semester, we will read and explore a number of topics and ideas regarding the development of a sustainable arts practice, all the while, developing a specific set of questions pertinent to each class member’s interests in the concentration. At the end of the seven weeks, students will present (both in person and online) on a company or artist whose work you have been researching in depth (the options are outlined in week 7 of the syllabus). We then pivot to your topics brought up during the first half of the semester – in essence the class will be building and completing the syllabus for the last half of October and November and December, while discussing and workshopping the development of their thesis ideas.","Required of all, and limited to, concentrators.",Faculty of Arts & Sciences,4,Not Available for Cross Registration,"Theater, Dance & Media",Tutorial,N/A,FAS Letter Graded,N/A,N/A,N/A,Arts and Humanities

Through a series of cases, students address these issues as if they were professionals at the National Security Council working for the President or an assistant to the Secretary of State or Defense. In response to specific assignments, students write Strategic Options Memos that require analyzing the challenge, assessing the current strategy, and identifying alternative strategies for protecting and advancing national interests.  Assignments require strategic thinking: analyzing dynamics of issues, formulating key judgements, and developing feasible strategies. In the real world of Washington today, this means thinking clearly about what the US is attempting to achieve in the world in the midst of a swirl of a government whose deliberations are often discombobulated by leaks, press reports, tweets, and fake news. A sub-theme of the course explores ways in which pervasive press coverage intrudes, sometimes informing, sometimes distorting, national security decision making.  In addition, the course will include several related side bars where we will discuss Applied History, “behind the veil” at a major newspaper, strategy (as taught at the Naval War College), intelligence analysis, and basic numeracy.  This course is open by instructor consent.

The course also explains how policy makers can dampen economic fluctuations using monetary policy (i.e., government influence over interest rates and government regulation of banks), fiscal policy (e.g., government control of spending and taxation), and financial rescues in economic crises. We will also discuss how macroeconomic policies work in an international context, including the factors that affect exchange rates, trade deficits, international capital flows, and how these link economies around the world.

Is there such a thing as an immaterial soul distinct from your body? Is immortality something you should want in the first place?

Interestingly, as our lives become more digitized and removed from IRL reality, dance has gained a “new life” in the virtual world, through videos on social media and streaming platforms. As stages are swapped for smartphones, what changes can be felt, for choreographers, performers and audiences? How are the experiences of attention, agency, effort, empathy, space and time different in both mediums? And perhaps most interestingly, what happens when the worlds collide, and video technology “invades” the physical stage?In this course, we will be examining these questions through an historical survey of dance in media, and direct embodied research, manifesting as weekly choreographic experiments. Starting from a place of no particular presumed movement experience (ie. this class is equally for the ballet pro, breakdance influencer, and living room dancing queen) we will be investigating and inventing various methods of making, with and without technology. We will learn various techniques of capture (cameras) and display (monitors and projectors), which in turn will lead to experiments with incorporating video back into live performance.

How did they get to be grouped together in a single book called the ""New Testament""? In addition to these historical questions, we will also attend to the New Testament's ongoing role as Christian scripture to consider the following: what does it mean to study a religious text critically? How might the study of the New Testament's social and historical context relate to its ongoing role as sacred and/or authoritative in the Christian tradition? And what are some of the diverse ways that contemporary readers bridge the gap between the New Testament's ancient Greco-Roman context and their own interpretation and application?

We will use the ancient material as a jumping off point to debate modern legal topics such as the role of victims in the criminal process, jury nullification, the proper exercise of discretion in prosecution and sentencing, the provocation doctrine in modern homicide law, transitional justice institutions (human rights prosecutions, amnesties, truth commissions); theories of punishment, the use of collective sanctions in international law, free speech and the protection of dissent in a democratic society, and direct vs. representative models of democracy. Approximately half of each class session will be devoted to discussing the Athenian cases, the other half to discussing analogs in modern legal debates.",,Faculty of Arts & Sciences,4,Not Available for Cross Registration,First Year Seminar Program,Seminar,N/A,FAS Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory,Course open to Freshman Students Only,N/A,N/A,N/A

Some of you, upon encountering in the previous sentence words like “programming” and “numerical simulations,” will feel the cold hand of fear grip your stomach, because you have never done any programming and, in fact, have tried to avoid math as much as possible. If so, YOU ARE PRECISELY THE PERSON WE HAD IN MIND as we were planning the course. We are aiming to help you break through this barrier of darkness and fear into the radiant sunshine of quantitative enlightenment. The true beauty of PYTHON, as we will personally demonstrate, is that it allows people who are not mathematically adept (e.g. some of the instructors of this course) to use powerful numerical methods and visualization tools to gain an understanding of concepts that are very difficult to grasp analytically.","The camp is primarily designed for those of you with no prior programming experience. If you fit this description, you should definitely plan to take the course.

In the recent history of Latin America, there are multiple instances where aesthetics and politics have intertwined in order to create and find new meanings for the issues plaguing the region. If a citizen participates in both the action of being governed and the action of governing, there is no doubt that aesthetics, understood as the formal exploration of the distribution of the sensible, as Rancière would say, is a productive space for analysis to understand Latin American intellectual and political traditions.In this course, we will panoramically explore the relationship between aesthetics and politics throughout the 19th, 20th, and 21st centuries in Latin America. By studying cinema, literature, art, music, and more, the objective is to offer students an approach to how art and culture bear witness, often in a more visceral and affective way than is possible from a purely historiographical or sociological approach, to what politics cannot resolve. We will analyze and discuss Latin American productions based on key aesthetic concepts (manifesto, declamation, performance, documentary, etc.), in order to trace and outline the anxieties plaguing both art and contemporary Latin American criticism.",Conducted in Spanish.,Faculty of Arts & Sciences,4,Available for Harvard Cross Registration,Romance Languages & Lit,Lecture,N/A,FAS Letter Graded,N/A,N/A,N/A,Arts and Humanities

This examination allows us to scrutinize just over a hundred years of novelistic development and experiment – from 1813 to 1927, from Jane Austen to Virginia Woolf – a period that might rightly be considered the high-point of the novel’s rise. We will discover that as the novelistic treatment of consciousness changes, so the idea of what a mind (or a self) is, also changes: the form (the means of representation) modifies the content (what is represented). What might seem at first like a fairly small thing – a question of novelistic technique – will turn out to have massive and far-reaching consequences for our sense of self.

We also study the history of data systems, traditional and seminal concepts and ideas such as the relational model, row-store database systems, optimization, indexing, concurrency control, recovery and SQL. In this way, we discuss both how and why data systems evolved over the years, as well as how these concepts apply today and how data systems might evolve in the future.

This course will motivate statistical methods through data analysis and visualization, in addition to discussing the underlying theory. We will discuss topics such as study design, descriptive statistics, probability, sampling distributions, hypothesis testing, linear regression, and Bayesian inference. A wide variety of applications from the economic and social sciences will be highlighted along with examples from biology, sports, politics, and more. Students with prior exposure to introductory statistics will find some overlap of material but be exposed to new applications and learn more advanced modeling techniques.

(2) How does each philosopher’s view of human psychology and epistemology constrain, guide, and support their moral theorizing?

As our communication becomes ever more digital— and, therefore, simultaneously more ephemeral and more durable—the attitudes and tools we have for preserving our culture have come to seem less apt than they may have seemed as recently as a generation ago. This course examines how texts have been transmitted from the past to the present, and how we can plan for their survival into the future. We will examine what makes texts durable by considering especially the media by which they are transmitted, the changing cultural attitudes toward their content, and the institutions by which they are preserved. The European Renaissance will provide a central case study. During this period scholars became aware of the loss of ancient texts and strove to recover and restore them insofar as possible. These interests prompted new developments in scholarly conservation techniques which we still value today (philology, libraries, and museums) but also the creation and transmission of new errors, ranging from well-intentioned but overzealous corrections and “improvements” to outright forgeries. What can the Renaissance teach us about how to engage productively with these problems, both as the source of our current attitudes toward preservation and loss, and as a case study of another culture dealing with anxiety over preservation and loss? Ultimately, we hope that students will be able to think productively about preservation in the past and in the future, while recognizing that all preservation inherently involves some kind of transformation.",,Faculty of Arts & Sciences,4,Not Available for Cross Registration,General Education,Lecture,N/A,FAS Letter Graded,N/A,"Aesthetics and Culture

They lived thirty years and thirty miles apart, met only once over a period of some days, and wrote long, completely different books, both inspired by what they understood as visionary encounters with the divine. Julian was a Christian intellectual, a brilliant writer, intensely visual but also abstract, who spent a lifetime writing and rewriting an intricate and optimistic analysis of how to live as an aspiring and suffering human being in the world that many people around the world still live by. Margery (she did not much like her husband’s name) was a religious experimentalist, devout globe-trotter and performance artist, equally brilliant, whose energies seemed to have gone into living more than writing, but who in old age dictated then revised what many understand as the first English autobiography. After being mostly ignored for several hundred years, they are now being read with care, although by different readerships and in different ways. It is time they were brought together again.In this discussion-based course, we read Julian of Norwich’s Revelation of Love and The Book of Margery Kempe  alongside one another, as well as in the light other women writers who drew inspiration from visions, revelations, or dreams, from the early Christian martyr Perpetua of Carthage in the third century CE to the reclusive New England poet Emily Dickinson in the nineteenth. We pay particular attention to Julian and Margery’s direct precursors, Angela of Foligno, Gertrude the Great, and Marguerite Porete, among others. We consider how it was that revelations were able to make an innovative, demanding and prestigious mode of thought and writing possible for women who were excluded by their gender from the formal education available to male contemporaries. We think about what revelations are, how they function as an embodied, kinetic, and dialogic mode of consciousness, and the stylistic and intellectual experimentation this mode of consciousness enables. We speculate on potential connections between the visionary and other non-natural ways of seeing the world.

It aims to build a knowledge base of historically contextualized case studies through readings, lectures, and discussion. It examines clothing as a site of societal debate, personal and collective identity formation, and philosophical inquiry. Theoretical readings will allow students to apply what they learn to a variety of topics beyond East Asia for final papers and projects. Topics will engage with issues of gender, colonialism, and racialization in inter-Asian and internationalist contexts. Methods of analysis will include examining 1) the image of fashion and clothing (photographs, film, visual media, memory); 2) fashion as text, or written clothing—how clothing becomes fashion through discourse; and 3) the materiality of dress. To study materiality, the course includes a lab section where students will examine closely textiles and articles of clothing in the collections of the Harvard Museums, and engage in materials workshops (learning for example weaving and dyeing techniques). Students will be encouraged to make connections between form and function and meaning, and to incorporate a knowledge of technological constraint and possibility into their own analyses of clothing and fashion.",This course will also include a one-hour Materials Lab.

We will analyze how African and black diasporic authors and intellectuals have engaged with, revised, and re-imagined the classics of ancient Greece and Rome, both to expose and critique discourses of racism, imperialism, colonialism, and white supremacy, and as a rich source of radical self-expression. The course will be arranged thematically, taking in uses of Classics in literature, art, journalism, and politics. Writers, artists, and politicians whose work and ideas we will study include Phillis Wheatley, William Sanders Scarborough, Anna Julia Cooper, Pauline Hopkins, Mary Church Terrell, Edmonia Lewis, W.E.B.

Whereas the course will discuss papers from strategy and closely related fields, it is not a survey of models in these fields or any subfield but will simply draw on these literatures to provide material to learn about theory and theory development.

From its natural history origins during the 19th century, paleontology has become a cornerstone of neo-Darwinian evolutionary thought, produced a detailed log of climate change, and sits at the center of a multi-billion-dollar business consumed by millions of people around the world, most likely yourself included. This seminar will explore the rich world of paleontology and its bearing on human activities. You will learn how cutting-edge scientific research informs our understanding of the main processes that have influenced the evolution of Life on Earth for approximately four billion years, including episodes of global warming/cooling and mass extinction events. You will also gain insights into the socioeconomic impact of fossils, ranging from the seamless integration of charismatic extinct animals into culture and entertainment, to ethical and political quandaries resulting from the unregulated exploitation of these natural resources in conflict zones. Finally, we will explore how technological advances blur the lines between science fiction and reality, allowing us to visualize diminutive, fossilized animal-like embryos from 600 million years ago, to the potential (and controversial) applications of gene editing to resuscitate extinct species such as the wooly mammoth and Tasmanian tiger.",This seminar will run for 2 hours only within the time block.,Faculty of Arts & Sciences,4,Not Available for Cross Registration,First Year Seminar Program,Seminar,N/A,FAS Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory,N/A,N/A,N/A,None

Less often invoked, however, is an older, more metaphysical notion of ‘nature naturing’ actively (natura naturans). When (if ever) did the concept of the ‘environment’ replace that of nature? What are the exact differences between the terms we use to refer to the planet as our shared home, whether ‘nature,’ ‘(e/E)arth,’ ‘world,’ ‘environment,’ ‘planet,’ or ‘globe’? And what ramifications might the semantic shifts between these six terms have for current environmental debates?] This interdisciplinary course asks these questions by examining three phases in the history of the idea of nature as instigated by key German poets, thinkers, and visual artists. Beginning with the period around 1800, we will reconstruct the tensions animating Romanticism’s holistic conception of nature by reading works by Kant, Goethe, Schelling, and Alexander von Humboldt, while the landscape paintings of Caspar David Friedrich will furnish our artistic case study. Turning to the first half of the twentieth century, we will encounter the first use of the German term Umwelt (‘environment’) in its modern sense in the work of theoretical biologist Jakob von Uexküll, who was friends with the poet Rainer Maria Rilke. We will reconstruct Martin Heidegger’s critique of modern technology and compare and contrast his conception of the artwork’s ties to ‘earth’ and ‘world’ vis-à-vis comparison to Schelling’s theory of the artwork’s relation to nature. Our exemplary artist for this second phase is Paul Klee, who grounded his aesthetic vision in nature’s formative processes. Approaching our contemporary moment, we will read literary works by W.G. Selbald while attending to the political and communicative vicissitudes of coming to societal awareness of a transhistorical phenomenon such as climate change. Joseph Beuys’s politico-aesthetic agitations and the first photos of the Earth taken from outer space provide our last artistic case studies.

What is socialism? How has its meaning changed over time? Why did the reality of socialism, particularly in the Soviet Union, turn out so differently from its promise of abundance, harmony, and freedom? How does Marx’s vision of history figure into the socialist project? What assumptions about human beings underlie the conviction that socialism would constitute progress? What are the assumptions that suggest that socialism would be destructive?

Examining how these authors draw on traditions crafted by earlier authors such as James Baldwin and Virginia Woolf, we’ll ask what this tradition has accomplished in different historical moments and how genres such as the “personal essay” and the “op-ed” have been implicitly gendered. We will think about our own cultural moment, in which we are collectively encouraged to “tell our story” via an endless proliferation of self-revelatory texts (blogs, TikTok, Twitter). Why has the genre of “the personal” become so popular in the 21st century and what does this signal for the future of feminist/queer thought and inquiry?

Topics include ways utility theory can be improved--such as incorporating reference dependence, news utility, social preferences, self image, and other belief-based tastes--and ways we can relax assumptions of perfect rationality--such as incorporating focusing effects, limited attention, biased prediction of future tastes, present-biased preferences, biases in probabilistic judgment, and errors in social inference. The course will emphasize (a) careful interpretation and production of new evidence on relevant departures,(b) formalizing this evidence into models that can, with discipline and rigor, generate sharp predictions using traditional economic approaches, and (c) exploring economic implications of those models presented. Although we will primarily emphasize (b), the course is meant to be useful to students whose interests lie anywhere in this spectrum, under the premise that all such research will be improved by a greater appreciation of the full spectrum.

While heart disease, cancer and other significant medical challenges will be explored,  this year special emphasis will be placed on mental health.  Comparative psychopathology—studying mental illness and abnormal behavior in fish, reptiles, birds, and non-human mammals—will be introduced as a framework strengthening our understanding of human depression, eating disorders, social anxiety, OCD, self-injury, addiction and other emotional and biobehavioral challenges. Taught by a physician and evolutionary biologist, this course uses a ‘mini-medical school’ approach to explore the evolutionary origins of disease. Each lecture takes on a specific common and challenging human health issue beginning with a brief overview of what modern medicine currently does and does not understand. Lectures then quickly move into the wild (literally–through the use of curated wildlife video) and into our evolutionary past that has shaped modern vulnerabilities. Students will explore Harvard Museum of Natural History collection and learn to build phylogenetic models to develop an expanded understanding of the nature and origin of mental and physical illness. No prior medical or advanced scientific knowledge is assumed. Both physical and mental illnesses will be covered. As noted above, this year mental health will receive special focus.

Why does the Mexico-U.S. border continue to be a space of discussion and controversy? In the twenty-first century, as nations across the world militarize or rebuild their borders, the U.S.-Mexico border serves as a vital case study to understand the ongoing trend of tightening national borders—it also allows us to better understand our own history, politics, and how we shape our view of the world. In addition to examining the creation of the U.S.-Mexico border in 1848 to the present, this course examines how ideas of public health have historically been used in border debates. For many, the border served (and serves) as a protective barrier from poverty, violence, and, especially, disease. By the early twentieth century many Mexican bodies were perceived as “alien,” “illegal,” and in need of patrolling. Yet these descriptions were also used by Mexican politicians to describe and isolate Indigenous groups and the Chinese within Mexico. By examining, for example, border ecological disasters, response to epidemics and a pandemic, and how ideas of race and health played out within Mexico and the U.S. we can better understand borders in general.",,Faculty of Arts & Sciences,4,Not Available for Cross Registration,General Education,Lecture,N/A,FAS Letter Graded,N/A,"Histories, Societies, Individuals",N/A,None

Students will learn the fundamentals of dynamic programming and the linear quadratic regulator (LQR) before delving into trajectory optimization and model predictive control (MPC) for nonlinear systems, which emphasizes numerical optimization techniques for synthesizing complex motions.The second half explores reinforcement learning (RL) for systems with unknown dynamics. Topics include both model-free and model-based RL algorithms such as proximal policy optimization (PPO), actor-critic methods, and model-based policy optimization, with a focus on continuous state and action spaces. Additional topics may include Lyapunov analysis, vision-based feedback control, and advanced convex optimization. The course prioritizes computational algorithms over theoretical analysis, equipping students with practical tools for solving complex control problems. Assignments involve programming in Python and MATLAB to control simulated dynamical systems in MuJoCo and other environments.",Engineering Sciences 158 is also offered as Applied Mathematics 158.

Inspired by such cooking mastery, we will then explore the science behind the recipes. Students will gain a solid understanding of the properties and fundamental behaviors of soft matter materials. All food is made of soft materials, and cooking relies on many of their fundamental properties. Topics will include:  emulsions, illustrated by aioli; elasticity, exemplified by the done-ness of a steak; and diffusion, revealed by the phenomenon of spherification, the culinary technique pioneered by Ferran Adria.

What diagnoses were they making? What treatments did they offer? How did they understand human anatomy and physiology?   A millennium later, the Hippocratic physicians emerged on the Aegean Island of Cos.  These physicians left us carefully stated surgical principles based, at least partly, on observation and measurement.  Why did they record their wisdom in the form of aphorisms? At around the same time, Shushruta, in what is now India, appears to have offered surprisingly modern surgical care to his patients.  Who was he?   In the second century CE Galen of Pergamum bursts on to the scene, intending to restore Hippocratic orthodoxy. Why was surgical thinking for nearly two millennia dominated by this his, often erroneous, teaching?  The Islamic Golden Age, an explosion of scientific and medical discovery, is a key to our understanding of all that follows in surgical history.  Why is this period overlooked today? How did the exposure of Galen’s anatomical imprecision by Vesalius in 1543 and his absurd physiology by Harvey in 1628 begin a Medical Enlightenment?  Why did it take until the 19th century for surgeons solve the riddles of anesthesia and antisepsis?   What were the roles of surgeons in the Eugenics movement and the Holocaust?  Is the advice of the Hippocratic physicians that “To understand surgery one must go to war” true in the 21st Century?Our study will examine these questions and many more.  We will visit the site of the first use of ether anesthesia and explore the human body in the anatomy lab at Harvard Medical School. We will admire rare first additions of the great works of surgical history at the Countway Medical Library.  From time to time we will be joined by doctors with expertise in specific areas such as anesthesiology, combat surgery, and anatomy.","The seminar will visit the site of the first use of ether anesthesia (the Ether Dome) and explore the human body in the anatomy lab at Harvard Medical School.

Core components of the class include the idea of navigating a situation as you actually would in real life, how to read a scene or monologue to figure out what your character might want from a situation, and “action-based acting” (how a person might go about getting what they want from the other person). We’ve designed the class around very tangible and concrete ideas and techniques, so that those who might be intimidated by the idea of an acting class, or an arts class in general, will feel exceedingly comfortable. We always have a lot of students from non-art concentrations who have had no previous art class experience.It is important to note that while the class is intentionally designed to be unintimidating, friendly and warm, the class does require a great deal of outside work.

It is in the midst of the most extraordinary economic transformation the world has seen. This development comes on top of the political, social, and cultural revolutions of the 20th century. All these changes occur against a deep historical background still much in evidence.This course explores how the world's largest and oldest bureaucratic state has dealt with enduring problems of economic and political organization. It will show how even modern answers to these challenges bear the imprint of China's history.  We will explore intellectual and religious trends, material and political culture, the tension between local society and the center, art and literature, and China’s multiple economic and political transformations. The consequences of the ancient Chinese political ideal of a single, civilized world empire is a central theme of the course, both from the comparative perspective of other multi-ethnic empires and in terms of the ever-broadening scope and intensity of China’s global connections.  We will draw comparisons with Rome between the 2nd century BCE to the 2nd century CE; with Romanov and Soviet realms in the 17th century and 20th centuries, respectively; and with Western global empires of the age of high imperialism in 19th and 20th centuries.  All these empires have come and gone, while a unitary, multi-national, Chinese empire has endured.On one hand, this has been a history of conflict, in which Chinese empires used military force to control the peoples on their borders. When they failed, border peoples incorporated China into their own inland empires: the Mongols in the 13th century and Manchus in the 17th.  On the other hand, it has been a history of economic and cultural relations, in which China absorbed foreign models (Buddhism from India in the 3rd century; the sovereign nation-state system from the West in the 19th century; and both industrial capitalism and Stalinist socialism in the 20th century),  defended trade by land along the Eurasian silk routes and by sea with South and Southeast Asia, and put itself forward as a model state for others in East Asia and beyond.The course will enable students to debate how the choices China has made in the past bear on the challenges it faces today, when a modern “China model,” with ancient roots, competes with the United States for global leadership.The course is taught with multiple pedagogies.  By shifting lecture to on-line modules that include “field trips” to sites in China, class time is focused on active, participant-centered learning around major texts, works of art, and contemporary case studies.   Class preparation and attendance are mandatory.  Assignments include responses to online modules, weekly sections, a midterm examination, and a final group project.",,Faculty of Arts & Sciences,4,Available for Harvard Cross Registration,General Education,Lecture,N/A,FAS Letter Graded,N/A,"Histories, Societies, Individuals",N/A,None

At present marauding vampires and the walking dead are everywhere (and then, too, there are the internet trolls). Our world seems to dedicate a lot of energy to exactly the fears we thought we were supposed either to have exorcised by becoming modern and disenchanted or to have exorcised simply by growing up and no longer needing to look under our beds before falling asleep at night. Why does the monstrous compel us? To help explain the fascination with the monster, this course looks backward, to nineteenth-century Gothic fiction and to the horror cinema that took up its mantle. The course’s premise is that by taking seriously monsters’ staying power we can learn a lot--about, for instance, the way the horror tradition has helped modernity make sense of itself. Monster stories are stories about the failures built into our systems of categorization and notions of normality. They make vivid the potential for violence in the notions of cultural purity and cultural inheritance that modernity uses to organize its accounts of identity and community. We’ll begin in the year 1818 with Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein. Our next move will be to the fictions that were written in the shadow of that famous ghost-story competition that on a dark and stormy night ushered into being both Shelley’s monster and (via the poet Lord Byron and his traveling companion John Polidori) the first modern vampire.  Pursuit of this project will have us reading novels, novellas, and short stories by Sheridan Le Fanu, Bram Stoker, Mary Elizabeth Braddon, Robert Louis Stevenson, Gaston Leroux, H.G. Wells, and others. We’ll turn briefly near the end of the semester to the early horror films that gave the Gothic tradition’s recurring preoccupations with the animation of the dead a new lease on life. Bringing the story of the class up to the present, we’ll conclude the semester with some episodes of Ben Stiller’s Apple TV show Severance.",,Faculty of Arts & Sciences,4,Available for Harvard Cross Registration,English,Lecture,N/A,FAS Letter Graded,N/A,N/A,N/A,Arts and Humanities

We read these works through a late-medieval Aristotelian understanding of the imagination as a fundamental but fallible instrument of human perception, observing how they respond to traditions of writing about dreams, visions, and journeys to heaven or hell that go back to classical and Christian antiquity, in which human cognition and the shape of the cosmos are thought about very differently. We consider the inter-relationship between the poetic and the visionary in light of the categories of orthodoxy and discretion of spirits, at a period when both were fiercely contested. We also consider visionary writing and the contradictory claims it makes for the truth of intense imaginative experience as a precursor of the ubiquitous but puzzling modern concept of fiction, with special early reference to W. G. Sebald's 2001 novel Austerlitz. Texts not written in English will be read mainly in translation; no previous knowledge of Middle English, or of medieval visionary writing, is required.","Space permitting, this course is open to qualified undergraduates.

The goal of this course is twofold: first, to familiarize the students with the variety of attested reading traditions and, second, to introduce them to the periodization of Biblical Hebrew. In each case we will read portions of texts to better grasp the main linguistic differences between reading traditions and between chronolects, and to understand the interpretative implications of such differences. We will begin with a detailed and advanced study of the Tiberian reading tradition, whose basic features the students already know. We will then explore the less known, yet prestigious, Babylonian reading tradition, which we will compare to the more familiar Tiberian one. Finally, the students will be introduced to the so-called popular reading traditions, that is the Palestinian reading tradition and the transliterations of portions of texts and words of the Hebrew Bible into Greek (e.g., Origen’s Secunda and those found in the Septuagint) and into Latin (e.g., Jerome). To conclude our study of reading traditions, we will study the Samaritan reading tradition and read portions of the Samaritan Pentateuch. With regards to periodization and linguistic diachrony, the students will be introduced to the distinctive features (mostly syntactic and semantic) of the three main chronolects of Biblical Hebrew and their respective textual corpora: Classical Biblical Hebrew (pre-exilic); Transitional Biblical Hebrew (exilic); Late Biblical Hebrew (post-exilic).

Class time will be devoted primarily to learning to read the primary sources in translation; supplementary secondary readings will provide historical and cultural context. The seminar will also include regular visits to Houghton Library to look at manuscripts, early printed editions, and facsimiles of these books in order to study the changing shapes these books have taken as a key to understanding how they were studied and used, and to consider the relationship of materiality to textuality.

It is also clear that the power of AI today is at an inflection point. The rise of deep learning architectures like the Transformer has yielded models capable of an array of impressive tasks, from seamless human-like conversation to composing symphonies. While these advances incorporate specialized machine learning models, the advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) present a broad array of possibilities. LLMs have surprised the scientific community and even their creators by exhibiting emergent abilities once thought to be uniquely human, such as fairly advanced cognition and reasoning, although the full extent of these accomplishments is debated. Yet, despite this excitement, substantive efforts at testing the cognitive and social abilities of general-purpose AI models is in its early stages. The technology behind ChatGPT, for example, while impressive, is not without problems, and even dangers. Research has shown that these models can amplify patterns of bias in their training corpus. While capable of passing standardized tests in varied domains, these models are strikingly poor at solving mathematical problems and transformers are more generally less successful in solving problems external to their training data. Despite these shortfalls, the promise of this technology – still in its infancy – is enormous. Because “[t]he purpose of science is to develop, without prejudice or preconception of any kind, a knowledge of the facts, the laws, and the processes of nature” we will apply this commitment to understanding the cognitive and social features revealed in ongoing discoveries (i.e., unpublished research) about LLMs by the participants in the course.   This course is geared towards graduate students (and some qualified undergraduates) from various disciplines, especially psychology, computer science and related fields. Students will present their ongoing research to the class and as such, this course is only for students already engaged in research on the cognitive and social aspects of LLMs. This course will be organized like a lab meeting, with the weekly topics being constructed out of the projects of the participating students.

Following the lead of these culture-makers and their work, we will draw on the new science of plant communication and learning in this class; uncover plant-based histories and renew ancient understandings of human-plant relations. But plants themselves will also be primary sources, as each student follows a sequence of exercises to deepen understanding of a plant ""interviewee""—one they'll grow at home from an unidentified seed. At the same time, we will ask critical questions: with climate crisis upon us, in a time of social inequity, poisonous politics, and mass dislocations, why this attraction to plants?

Each week you’ll engage in complementary sessions — “bench” and “bedside” — that bridge the gap between scientific foundations and practical applications. In bench sessions, you will engage in lectures exploring historical discoveries and modern methodologies in gene regulation, foster critical thinking through in-class discussions, and critique primary research publications. Topics covered will include genome architecture, gene expression, RNA processing, and the non-coding genome. In bedside sessions, you will learn to visualize and interpret human genomic and transcriptomic data through public genome browsers (no coding required), and you will practice designing CRISPR, siRNA, and ASO therapeutics for disease. As a final project, you will draw upon insights acquired from bench and bedside sessions to design a novel therapeutic strategy for a genetic condition, which will be presented in class.This course offers a unique opportunity to explore aspects of gene regulation, from its molecular foundation to practical implementation in gene therapy.",,Faculty of Arts & Sciences,4,Available for Harvard Cross Registration,Molecular & Cellular Biology,Lecture,N/A,FAS Letter Graded,N/A,N/A,N/A,Science & Engineering & Applied Science

Unfolding across Afro-Eurasia, the Medieval Islamic Commercial Revolution wove together a world system of unprecedented reach and strength, as new trade networks extended across land and sea to join the Mediterranean and the Indian Ocean, North and Sub Saharan Africa, Central and South Asia, reaching all the way to China. As a result of this momentous development, technologies such as paper-making spread from East Asia all the way to Europe; new crops such as sugar, cotton, and citruses started being cultivated across Afro-Eurasia; new “global” tastes developed, with Chinese porcelain becoming a common product in the Middle East and European elites becoming accustomed to South Asia spices. Yet the social and economic dynamics of this ‘globalization before globalization’ remain poorly understood. In following the lives and business activities of merchants (Muslim and not) of the Islamic world through the primary sources that they themselves produced (their letters, accounts, books), we will ask how this great feat was achieved. We will investigate the rise of new trade routes, the development of novel commercial and financial institutions, the connections and confrontations between merchants, workers, and rulers.","This course meets either the ""Pre-1750"" and ""Beyond North America"" History Concentration requirement, but not both.",Faculty of Arts & Sciences,4,Available for Harvard Cross Registration,History,Conference Course,N/A,FAS Letter Graded,N/A,N/A,N/A,Social Sciences

In our modern global economies, different markets are internationally intertwined, as technological advances have allowed for swift communication and economic dependence between practically all areas of the world. The shipping industry might be a salient example of this, where one cargo ship got stuck in the Suez Canal in 2021 and blocked the channel for six days, stranding ca. 400 vessels and delaying between $6 and $10 billion in trade per day, attesting to the importance of this trade route for the global economy. Yet, the use of this route for large scale long-distance sea voyages can be traced back at least to the Roman period, where there is evidence of cargo ships traveling from Muziris, India to the Red Sea Coast of Egypt, carrying with them 635 tonnes of cargo meant to travel all the way to Alexandria and Rome, and worth around 7 million Roman sesterces, the equivalent of the salary of seven senators at the time. In this case the ancient and the modern don’t seem so different.By analyzing the global connections of well-known ancient civilizations such as the Assyrian, Egyptian, Macedonian, Roman, and Palmyrene Empires, students will learn to see similarities to our own current global economic enterprises and learn not only of the challenges but also the social injustices and exploitation that take place in these global enterprises. Another particularly poignant example is the week where we study ancient global pandemics, seeing the ways in which they affected the labor force, the lower classes, agricultural production, and even politics, much like during our recent COVID-19 pandemic.Furthermore, students will learn how to dissect historical and analytical narratives that utilize quantitative and qualitative data sets through selected case studies spanning millennia between them. For example, the class covers the economic logistics of the military conquests of Alexander, the constructions of the pyramids of Old Kingdom Egypt, the economic and human price of urban development of the city of Rome, and the capital investment and merchant networks required for the long-distance trade along the Silk Roads and Indian Ocean trade routes.",,Faculty of Arts & Sciences,4,Available for Harvard Cross Registration,General Education,Lecture,N/A,FAS Letter Graded,N/A,"Histories, Societies, Individuals",N/A,None

Self-translation refers to the process through which authors translate their own writing into another language; such a translation may be undertaken at the same time as the original is composed or long after it is completed, but it always represents a self-reflexive relationship between the author and their own work. Because the self-translator has access to the original’s authorial intentions, they are empowered to take creative liberties that a conventional translator might shy away from. Through these creative liberties, self-translators enrich the cultural capital of both their native and adopted language and culture. Self-translation, in this way, often involves writing oneself into world literature, creating cosmopolitan palimpsests that reveal, in their dialogue with diverse cultural traditions, the nonlinear forms of modernity. In this course, we will delve into case studies of self-translation from East Asia, East Africa, Latin America, North America, and Italy.

It existentializes Aristotle’s ontology, systematizes the existential insights of Kierkegaard and Nietzsche, and on that basis offers a radical critique of Husserl’s phenomenological account of intentionality. The result is a dramatically original and compelling interpretation of the human condition. This interpretation leads, in turn, to an account of the nature of philosophical and scientific inquiry, as well as their limitations. Being and Time has important implications for all those disciplines that study human beings.  In this course we will explore major themes of this often bewildering work, with an emphasis on charitable interpretation:  What is the ‘question of Being?’  What is the relationship between theoretical knowledge and understanding-by-doing?  What is the nature of our social being?  What does it mean to be ‘inauthentic’ or ‘authentic,’ and what are the implications of human finitude?  Finally, what is the ‘Question of Being’?","This course is equivalent to Phil. 138.

Yet, we often fail to examine the implicit assumptions and approaches underlying our learning. In addition, we often overlook the importance of unlearning – the process of letting go of inaccurate information, misguided beliefs, harmful biases, limiting mindsets, and unproductive habits to make room for new learning. Unlearning has always been essential for replacing outdated and simplistic ideas with updated and sophisticated ones. Today, it has become even more critical due to contemporary challenges such as societal polarization and media echo chambers, the impact of generative AI and other technologies on traditional practices, the necessity for challenging the status quo to envision a more just society, and the urgent need for dialogue, understanding, and empathy in an increasingly tribalistic world. Intentionally examining the purposes and processes of learning and unlearning will help us become more effective (un)learners, and ultimately, illuminate how these processes can foster human flourishing in our current world and for future generations. In this course, we will engage with fundamental questions and debates, including:What does it mean to learn and unlearn? How do individuals prioritize the diverse purposes of learning, such as cultivating intellect, developing moral values, fostering personal growth, preparing for citizenship, and beyond? How do our experiences and cultural contexts influence our understanding of learning? How do we learn, and why do we learn in the ways that we do? When do we feel motivated or demotivated? How do schools nurture or stifle children’s natural curiosity? Do students learn better through teachers’ instruction or independent exploration? How do we monitor, evaluate, and adjust our own learning processes? How might generative AI be used to support or hinder learning? How do we decide what is worth learning and what should be unlearned? Why do we struggle to change our minds and habits, and what strategies can effectively facilitate this transformation? We will examine the cognitive, metacognitive or self-reflective, emotional, social, and moral dimensions of learning and unlearning. We will use a cross-cultural and interdisciplinary lens, analyzing cases from East Asian and Western cultures and draw insights from psychology, neuroscience, education, and philosophy. Class sessions are highly interactive and emphasize active learning. Students will engage in a range of activities including lectures, discussions, debates, case studies, interviews, group teaching exercise, storytelling, guest speaker sessions, and reflections on both personal learning processes and the pedagogical design of this course. This course welcomes all students to enroll and requires no prerequisites.",,Faculty of Arts & Sciences,4,Available for Harvard Cross Registration,General Education,Lecture,N/A,FAS Letter Graded,N/A,Science and Technology in Society,N/A,None

Having achieved independence from the Spanish crown, the newfangled republics were in dire need of a unifying discourse capable of weaving together history, identity, and political legitimacy. Each post-colonial state endeavored to articulate a coherent narrative that would cement its status as a nation, recognizable across the ages. The difficulties entailed in erecting such ‘foundational fictions’ were daunting, and Latin American historians, regardless of their ideology, drew on their ample literary skills to solve them. Their oeuvre, often epic in style and overwhelming in scholarship, offers a window into that nation-building era in which the boundaries between history and literature were still porous and undefined.This course serves as an introduction to 19th century Latin American historiography and its intimate but problematic relationship with literature.

The social and political manifestations of this long postmodernism—a divided Germany, the threat of nuclear war, the rise of the information age, the development of globalist identities and ecological awareness, a ""reunified"" Germany—are characterized by enormous rupture, discontinuity, and instability. Literary forms in this period are no different: the death of the author, a growing discontent with the realist novel, and the relegation of literature to a subset of media are all symptoms of an age in which fiction has come to question its own legitimacy. By the same token, however, this period also witnesses exhilarating experimentation and groundbreaking formal shifts that continue to influence our notions of what is possible in literature up to the present day.This course surveys key contributions to the literary avant-garde in German-speaking postmodern contexts. We will study a range of prose fiction by major authors from West Germany, East Germany, postwar Austria, and a post-Wall Germany, including Thomas Bernhard, Uwe Johnson, Christa Wolf, Alexander Kluge, W.G. Sebald, Rainald Goetz, and Jenny Erpenbeck. The course will consider problems of authorship, the challenges to constructing subjecthood, the boundaries between the fictional and non-fictional, the influence of electronic media on prose forms, the relation of text to image, the response of fiction to market forces and historical trauma—and how each of these topics contributes to our understanding of the often overused signifier ""postmodernism."" This course will also examine a sample of key theoretical texts on the failure of modernism and whatever must come after it by Theodor W. Adorno, Roland Barthes, Fredric Jameson, Audre Lorde, and Jean-Francois Lyotard. Students will leave this seminar with a strong command of the ideas, styles, and provocations found in German literature from the end of World War II to the contemporary moment, as well as a clear idea of the debates and stakes at the heart of postmodernism in Western contexts.","Readings in German or English, discussion in English.",Faculty of Arts & Sciences,4,N/A,Germanic Languages & Lit,Lecture,N/A,FAS Letter Graded,N/A,N/A,N/A,Arts and Humanities

Cinema, by its very form, presents a world that is both present and absent, immersive yet untouchable, exposing the instability of meaning and the uncertainty of reality. Kierkegaard describes angst as “the dizziness of freedom,” while Heidegger sees it as a fundamental mood that reveals the “groundless ground” of our human existence. Film does not merely depict these tensions—it enacts them through its very form. Its aesthetic and structural choices manipulate time, space, and perspective, drawing the viewer into an experience where meaning and reality are unstable.We will analyze the work of seminal directors, including Luis Buñuel, Fritz Lang, Carl Dreyer, Andrei Tarkovsky, Alfred Hitchcock, Stanley Kubrick, Rainer Werner Fassbinder, Lars von Trier, Ari Aster, Kiyoshi Kurosawa, David Lynch, and Michael Haneke.

This seminar seeks to answer these questions through the study of the hatred of Jews, commonly known as antisemitism.  Jews have lived throughout the world over thousands of years, and they have been hated for diverse and at times contradictory reasons – they are said to be too different or trying too hard to fit it; religious extremists or extremist secularists; rich capitalists or revolutionary socialists; having no nation or roots, or fanatically attached to the state of Israel.  Are there aspects of antisemitism, or other forms of group hatred, that transcend these differences and have common bonds? Is antisemitism an illness, or a symptom of a variety of maladies? In this seminar, we will address these questions. We will do so by tracing Jew-hatred from antiquity to the present, in both Christian and Islamic lands. Our approach will be anchored in history, but we will draw upon insights from the humanities, such as theology and philosophy, and the social sciences, such as sociology and psychology.

Later, in an interview with Professor Carrasco, Morrison stated, “When I read his book One Hundred Years of Solitude, I literally said, “Oh, my God, you can do this”—meaning magic, strange stuff—and be deadly serious. So, that freed me up in my writing. Reading him unlocked something important for me. ”This course is a comparative and critical study of the religious dimensions in their writings and lives with special attention to the themes of religious experience, homeland and quests, Africa and Latin America, ""rememory"" and myths, goodness and the literary imagination. We engage with four types of “texts” and link them together to decipher the ties between the writer’s lives, countries, politics, liberation movements and their writings; autobiographical fragments, novels, film, critical reflections.

Introduction To The Hindu Calendar as a Lived Experience,HDS 3394,Radha Blinderman,2025 Fall,Full Term,2025-09-02,2025-12-03,3:00pm,4:15pm,Mon Wed,19538,226551,Instructor,0/20,0,False,True,False,True,False,False,False,"The purpose of this course is to acquaint someone completely new to the religious traditions of South Asia with Hinduism as a lived experience. It is meant to introduce students to ways of life that are informed by the most prominent sub-traditions of Hinduism today as they are reflected in the different versions of the Hindu calendar, also called Pañcāṅga or Pañjikā. Building on the history of different Hindu calendars, which consist of lunar dates (tithis), this course aims to give a broad overview of Hindu religious life as it revolves around festivals, fasts, seasonal rituals and pilgrimages that comprise each version of the calendar. Students will begin this journey with the Lunar New Year of the Vikrama Saṁvat calendar, which coincides with the end of the Spring Festival of Nine Nights (Caitra Navarātri) dedicated to the feminine divine, Śakti. After exploring the many ways in which the same event is celebrated in different regions, students will progress through the calendar towards the end of the year, learning about other major Hindu festivals along the way. Because of the diversity of religious perspectives in the sub-traditions of Hinduism, often the same events on these lunar calendars are imbued with multiple meanings and celebrated in various ways, so this course will put a special emphasis on learning when and how religious events are tied to entirely different mythologies and theologies, and how that creates opportunities for pluralistic encounters. Furthermore, since not all traditions under the umbrella of 'Hinduism' agree on one New Year or one supreme deity, the course also delves into alternative New Year celebrations, the deities and mythologies honored by them, and the issues of caste reflected by them. Throughout the course, students will learn about the ways in which devotees structure their lives around sacred dates, such as the birthdays and anniversaries of their chosen deities of worship, as well as commemorations of other mythological events. In addition to this, they will gain a perspective on food, visual art, dance, and music as aspects of life regulated by the Hindu calendar. Finally, the course will highlight cross-religious experiences, as certain major festivals transcend religious boundaries and share a history with some non-Hindu festivals that coincide with them. Knowledge of Sanskrit, other South Asian languages, or prior background in South Asian religions is not required for this course.

The question of Robert E. Lee/Marcus Aurelius); the entanglement between working the land and enslavement and the parallels and divergences between Roman and New World enslavement; the influence of Roman landscape design and horticulture on later American landscapes and gardens; the legacy of Roman surveying methods and centuriation in the mapping of the US; imperialism and the construction of the Other (Neoclassical portrayals of Indigenous figures in civic spaces in the guise of ancient Mediterranean barbarians); the translation and adoption of ancient Mediterranean and Roman visual culture in American cemeteries (including a class visit to Mount Auburn Cemetery).  Class visits: Mount Auburn Cemetery (reached via public transportation) and the Harvard Map Collection.",,Faculty of Arts & Sciences,4,Available for Harvard Cross Registration,"Classics, The",Seminar,N/A,FAS Letter Graded,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A

Merton excavated and taught the history of monasticism and Christian piety, living as a monk in the Gethsemane Monastery in Bardstown Kentucky, and became active in anti-Vietnam War politics until his untimely death from accidental electrocution in Bangkok in 1969. Buber was a leading philosopher/theologian and Zionist activist in Germany until his immigration to Mandate Palestine in the late 1930s and then became a voice of inspiration for humanistic Zionism, religious renewal, and the revival of Hasidism.This course will examine the writings and lives of both figures, paying close attention to their use of the past, theological worldviews, their understanding of a life of piety, and their commitment to political activism.

Lidar imagery from Professor Fash's famed site of Copan and many others in Mexico and Guatemala will be analyzed by the students for evidence of hitherto unknown archaeological roads, ceremonial centers, towns, and cities.

This seminar draws on anthropological perspectives to examine critically what has come to be known as the ""replication crisis"" in health science. Framing the crisis both as a moment of danger and of radical possibility, together we will explore how debates over replication illuminate deeper questions regarding the nature, stakes, and commitments of health science and its objects of study, as mediated through themes of representation, causality, error, epistemic virtue, risk, uncertainty, and objectivity. In doing so, we will consider how scientific authority is constructed and contested; how the replication crisis affects public trust, lay participation, and broader engagements with health and science; and unexpected opportunities the crisis may present to advance the cause of health equity. Through ethnographic readings, case studies, and interdisciplinary scholarship, students will analyze the drivers of the crisis and consider its implications for the future of scientific knowledge-making and health care delivery.",,Faculty of Arts & Sciences,4,Available for Harvard Cross Registration,Anthropology,Seminar,N/A,FAS Letter Graded,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A

In this seminar, we will examine the bio-social dimensions of disordered eating and being overweight as well as the volatility of weight ideals and their enduring moral salience. We will draw from anthropological and clinical perspectives to explore the rapidly shifting landscape of body shape ideals in the U.S. over the last century, the arrival of eating disorders in the Global South, the medicalization of obesity, and the emergence of pervasive weight stigma—as manifest in ‘fat shaming’ and even in policy interventions that have had unintended consequences. We will ask what the social structural determinants of obesity are, as well as how social adversities relating to the built environment, toxic food environment, climate change, and food deserts are embodied. We will examine variation in how the body is cultivated for self-presentation across diverse cultural contexts alongside evidence that the media have accelerated the globalization of thin ideals.  We will conclude by considering both emerging threats inherent to pervasive social media platforms and digital photo-shopping as well as potential opportunities to reset social norms through social movements and policy.",,Faculty of Arts & Sciences,4,Not Available for Cross Registration,First Year Seminar Program,Seminar,N/A,FAS Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory,N/A,N/A,N/A,None

Despite this range of methods for keeping politicians accountable, why is there still so much corruption and impunity within government? Why don’t politicians provide the policies and public services people seem to want?

We will explore movement techniques foundational to: creating characters; generating scripts and narratives; economizing and grounding stage presence; fostering ensemble cohesion; sensitizing the body to its unique capabilities of expression.Utilizing principles from Richard Maxwell, James Donlon, Charlie Oates, Anne Bogart, Blue Man Group and other ensembles/artists, we will attempt to anatomize an idealized ‘neutrality’, investigating the meaning and application of physical/environmental ’neutrality’ on stage. We will identify the roles personal idiosyncrasy and ‘disfluency’ can play in the pursuit of that neutrality, and the opportunities and challenges they present to the performer. We will investigate rudimentary components of story, uncovering along the way the most essential markers for perceiving story, emotion and thought in physical performance. We will explore the beginnings of creating character and story through gradual stages using both non-verbal and text-based story (solo body, body in relationship to object, bodies in interrelationship w/ each other). In the latter part of the semester, we will experiment with stylistic schools of physical performance, including mime, Blue Man Group, Charlie Oates sculpture work, clowning/acrobatics and Viewpoints, and will also investigate ensemble cohesion and material generation through games and improvisation. Throughout the semester’s explorations, we will also develop basic familiarity with simple yoga flow sequences, Taoist tai chi and other body practices geared toward conditioning/lengthening/ strengthening the physical instrument. The class will be both rigorously physical and dialectical, will include several short solo and ensemble performance pieces throughout the semester and will culminate in both a full-ensemble long form piece, as well as short individual pieces.","No prior acting/performance experience is necessary for this class! The class can become quite physical, so appropriate dress is strongly recommended (as is prior communication about any physical issues/pain that would effect your ability to move comfortably; alternatives to assigned movements that may cause issues can always be offered).

In fact, it marks the largest growth period in human development outside of infancy. Driven by enhanced thinking and reasoning capabilities, adolescents struggle with balancing their desires for autonomy andindependence with their desires for guidance and connection. These dynamics result in renegotiating family and social relationships and engagement in school, impact the effectiveness of educational practices, and enhance adolescents' ability to think and plan for their future. This course is designed to provide a practical understanding of the developmental issues, assets, and trajectories of adolescent thinking and reasoning. Based in classic and current theory and research and using real problems of practice, students will learn, integrate, and apply knowledge of biological and cognitive development and of identity processes. This course will prepare educational practitioners to integrate developmental approaches to their pedagogy and provide a foundation for those interested in applied research on adolescence.No prerequisites; prior course work in developmental psychology is helpful, but the course is designed for students without a psychology background.

By obscuring the truth in false narratives, or by communicating truths through narrative and arational means, myth has been interpreted as hostile to freedom, liberalism, rationalism, and deliberative democracy. And yet, despite Max Weber’s claim that the modern world had become ‘disenchanted,’ the last century saw an explosion of political myths implicitly and explicitly driving mass political movements. Political myth prompts key questions about political theory: Is it possible or even desirable to have a politics without myth? If not, then what role exactly does myth play in politics? Can political myths be open to contestation and reevaluation? Under what conditions can political myth be a means of oppression, and under what conditions can it serve emancipatory ends? To address these questions, this class will examine the relationship between myth and politics through a series of major theoretical statements drawn mostly from European intellectual history followed by a series of case studies.

Instructions are deployed to increase awareness of and further amplify sensation, and rather than turning from one prompt to another, information is layered, building into a multisensory, physically challenging experience.

Inside this shared research, the improvisational nature of Gaga’s explorations invites movers to develop deeper connections with their own movement, both inside of, and beyond, the studio.The research of Gaga is in a continual process of evolution; classes vary and develop accordingly.
