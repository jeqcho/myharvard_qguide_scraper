This class is NOT harder than Stat 110, I don&#x27;t know why people usually say that. A good model of ChatGPT can handle all of the PSET questions, and for the exams just do all the practice, make a good cheatsheet (do not just take someone else&#x27;s off of Ed, that&#x27;s not how you learn the material; actually sit down and read through the textbook and make your own), and don&#x27;t be stupid.  There&#x27;s no point in going to lecture, reading the textbook is fine (though still WiP and not as good as the 110 textbook).  Overall,  if you did well in Stat 110 (i.e., an A) and if for some reason you really want to learn about mathematical statistics, then you will be fine in this class.</td>

The homeworks are long and difficult, exams are the same, but I think it is a rewarding experience over all. If you really want to learn statistical inference on a deep level or are a statistics concentrator, I think this class is important and very interesting. Otherwise, I don’t think you should take it.

For context, I had little math background and limited programming experience. The course was highly applicable and after taking it, I understand the most updated material on machine learning, on quantitative finance and it really reinvigorated my love for statistics. 110 was more math and 111 is more application and it really helped understanding why the things we learned in 110 is important in real life. Also, I actually enjoyed the psets (which helped me reinforce the concepts). I do think that having more practice tests (110 had 10 and 1111 only had around 5) would have helped tremendously. They also finished the textbook this year so that also really helped.</td>

The 1st half of the course up to the midterm relies on the same unified concepts &ndash; MLE and their asymptotic distributions, but then post midterm you go into a bunch of tangential topics &ndash; regression, hypothesis testing, James&ndash;Stein estimator, sampling and causal inference which are harder conceptual to piece together and understand. This course was easier to understand than the competition&ndash;math, probability focused Stat 110 coming from someone who appreciates more of the statistical elements of analyzing causal effects and you build stronger Stat 110 skills. Joe and Neil are nice about grading — for context I bombed the midterm &ndash; got a 36, but did a lot stronger on the final &ndash; more than doubled my score and ended up receiving an A&ndash; for my efforts to improve. As long as you show the effort to show up to their office hours, talk to them about topics you’re struggling with and put in the effort to improve you can still survive this course. Would HIGHLY RECOMMEND GOING TO LECTURE EVEN IF BORING &ndash; spend the time to listen in to at least get the conceptual groundworks of topics presented to you and it will keep you personally on&ndash;track to at least stay engaged with the course rather than just going to section &ndash; which you should also do every week.</td>

I recall reading a QReport from a previous year before I took the class that said imagine completing Stat 110 psets and then having to latex them afterwards, and basically that&#x27;s what you do.  However much you struggled in 110 you&#x27;ll probably struggle just as much in 111, as even though you&#x27;re coming out of the former with a good probability background, the latter is more intense both theoretically and mathematically.  This is something I struggled with when it came time for the midterm and the final: some questions require one line of math that&#x27;s more theoretical (using Adam&#x27;s law or some such thing), and other questions require multiple lines of several integrals that you extract bits and pieces out of to arrive at your answer.  It can sometimes be difficult to discern whether to go down a mathematical rabbit hole or not is the trouble.  This might be a difficulty for statistics in general.  Still, I don&#x27;t want to lead on the wrong idea: Stat 111 is a great course that really helps you apply 110, and while it&#x27;s quite challenging it is equally rewarding.</td>

This course is also much less crowded than STAT 110, so the office hours are less hectic. If you liked intro&ndash;level stats (e.g., AP Stats), you&#x27;ll be able to prove&#x2F;better understand some cool results you may have seen before. You&#x27;ll also be introduced to new concepts that are really cool.<br/>&ndash; Both professors are very passionate about the topic, and it shows through lecture. But I think the majority of the learning is done in section (since the TFs often explain things the best in m opinion).<br/>&ndash; If you&#x27;re wondering what background you need, I think it&#x27;s a strong understanding of probability from STAT 110 and single&ndash;variable calculus (chain rule, product rule, and Taylor series). Also, a surprising amount of algebra shows up, so get comfortable with solving systems of equations, isolating variables, etc. (and don&#x27;t forget your log rules)!<br/>&ndash; Finally, this course is notorious for being difficult and time&ndash;consuming, but you&#x27;ll be able to survive! Especially with the right approach.<br/><br/>Here&#x27;s my advice on how to survive:<br/><br/>&ndash; Find a good section TF. I actually went to 2 sections most week because I felt like I didn&#x27;t learn much in lecture.<br/>&ndash; Find good OH, and keep a routine. Start early to avoid the Thursday rush.<br/>&ndash; Find good p&ndash;set buddies. They can save your life, especially with the code. Related, it&#x27;s a blessing that ChatGPT is allowed, but sometimes, it gets the code wrong, so be ready to debug and work through the process with some prompt&ndash;engineering.<br/>&ndash; For the exams, do EVERY practice exam as that gives you the best sense of what to expect.

As someone who did well in Stat 110 (and most people in this class did), 111 was not super interesting, and completely different course. To be expected, since this is actually STATISTICS, whereas Stat 110 is PROBABILITY. It is pretty plug and chug, and less creative problem solving. But I think as a result, it&#x27;s less intuitive and you have to actually learn the material. Which I did not.</td>

I feel like I didn&#x27;t engage with this class as much as I did for 110 (I watched lecture recordings religiously but stopped making it to lectures&#x2F;section). I honestly felt like watching recordings was helpful in that sometimes there was so much math going on that being able to pause it or rewatch made it somewhat comprehensible. The psets are much easier than in 110, however, I found the exams to be much harder. There is significantly less practice material because Joe + Neil haven&#x27;t been teaching the class together for as long, and sadly, there are also less people taking it. The class taught a lot of very applicable concepts that I&#x27;ve heard about but isn&#x27;t as connected&#x2F;cohesive as 110 felt, and in the second half of the class, it honestly felt like there was so much going on. I honestly also stopped reading the 111 textbook (our version was still a draft) although I had read the 110 book religiously. I found lecture + section notes (if Elvin is still a TF, his notes are amazing) + OH (Jasai&#x27;s is the best!!) to be sufficient.</td>

Mostly doing actual computation and math (less theory IMO), which is pretty nice. Textbook is the holy grail of this class (Joe writes a great textbook as usual). If you are interested in stats, comp sci, AI, ML, take this class for sure, it&#x27;ll set you up pretty well. Lectures are pretty good, sections are great too (shoutout Alice and Melissa). Overall if you took 110, take 111.</td>

If you struggle to pay attention in lecture like me, you will quickly learn that this class is structured only for the typical neurotic Harvard student. With LaTeX notes at every section and long textbook readings as the main avenue for building knowledge, the whole class felt so monotone. As someone who does so much better with more hands&ndash;on support, I often found myself incredibly lost in this course. <br/><br/>Don&#x27;t get me wrong, there were plenty of resources for success *on paper* for this course. But, they are all designed to help the students who are already succeeding continue to succeed. Every time I went to section, I felt as though they were teaching miles ahead of the content on the paper, with trick questions and loopholes and god knows what. And after I sat and thought about it, it all made sense. All the TFs (minus a few absolute GEMS) were selected out of a pool of previous stat 111 students who were already very well&ndash;versed in these concepts. So of course, they will naturally be teaching at a higher level leaving all the people who actually need help...behind. All I&#x27;ll say is, find yourself a TF who will support you at your specific knowledge level. and find one quick. (Shoutout Jasai for getting me thru this class!!! Absolute KING!)</td>

It&#x27;s where you get to use all the tools you learned in 110 to solve interesting and important questions, and after taking it you&#x27;ll start to see Stat 111 problems everywhere. The class itself is reasonable for the most part, but compared to 110 the curve is significantly tougher (because the top students from 110 are the ones who tend to take 111) and the psets are more tedious, so if you can take it Pass&#x2F;Fail I highly recommend it.</td>

If you liked 110, this is the natural followup and Joe and Neil are incredible instructors for the course. You go from data to parameters in this course whereas in 110 you went from parameters to data, so it’s a little more messy than 110 but there are still tricks you can use to make problems much easier pretty often and pretty much ALL of your 110 will be useful.<br/><br/>People are split over whether this is easier than 110; I heard more complaints in 110 but this might be because 111 is more self&ndash;selective. I will say that I personally much preferred 110 in terms of its content (and also because I knew more people taking it) and problem&ndash;solving methods, but 111 is as close as it gets and you will learn a lot of useful stuff. It is still very theory and math heavy but you also do R coding for PSETS and answer some cool questions such as using some prior distribution for the rate at which Hamilton and Madison each used the word “upon” in their Federalist Papers, updating with data of papers known to be written by either one or the other, to give a posterior probability for the chance a Federalist paper with contested authorship was written by Hamilton or Madison. <br/><br/>Tips: sections are AMAZING (even more helpful than in 110), the book is helpful but not quite as clear&#x2F;easy to read as 110 book due to the content being tougher to give lots of simple examples for (and very different conceptually). Exams are really really difficult and do all of the practice problems they give you, and more. R coding is tough with no experience but all doable, and TFs are amazing, so use office hours and have a group to work with when stuck.</td>

Don&#x27;t get me wrong. The material is very difficult. Studying for the final was probably the most intellectually challenging experience I put myself through. My brain felt like exploding while taking the final. <br/>However, on the daily&#x2F;weekly, Stat 111 was easier to handle than 110 because it is structured exactly the same as 110. As a result, you don&#x27;t have to go through the learning curve that you experience typically when taking the class of figuring out the best study methods&#x2F;best ways to complete the psets. I also found the 4 problem psets  to be more approachable than the 7 problem psets. <br/><br/>My advice on Stat 111:<br/>Utilize office hours, and start the psets as soon as Joe drops the pset (Friday evening). Then go to Saturday and Sunday office hours, and by Monday, you will be almost done with your pset. The 111 TF team is amazing,  just like the 110 TF team. <br/><br/>I wish I had also taken more time to understand the material conceptually more. It is easy to get lost in the numbers, and only understand the steps in executing to get the answers. That ended up hurting me in the long run for final studying. <br/><br/>If you are taking Stat 111 concurrently with Math 21B,  I would highly NOT recommend this combination. As my learning was greatly impeded in Stat 111, balancing the 3 psets a week with 21B. I would highly encourage exploring the 22A&#x2F;B series, although I know 22A is offered in the fall. I know my grade in BOTH of the courses would have been higher, if I took them alone, not with each other. This was the leading cause why my sophomore year was brutal and challenging. I&#x27;m grateful that I challenged myself but if I could go back and change my decisions, I would have taken 22A sophomore fall and 22B sophomore spring instead.</td>

Stat 111 is definitely a great class. It was good to see a lot of things from 110 in a more applied context. I do prefer 110 though, as 111 seemed like I was learning a bunch of different, somewhat unrelated techniques, as opposed to the interconnected nature of the 110 content. With that being said, I personally found 111 more manageable, as the psets are 4 questions instead of 7. Also, the questions on the psets and the tests are less tricky, due to the nature of the content.  Taking both Stat 110 and Stat 111 provides a strong statistical bases for almost any other stat course that is at Harvard, so I do suggest taking the both (and you&#x27;ll have to if your doing a major or minor in stat lol). Also, Joe, as you know from 110 is absolutely amazing, and Neil is great too! Make an effort to connect with them on a personal level by going to their office hours, as both are truly a pleasure to get to know. As for tips for the class, the textbook is again your best friend. Do your best to keep up with reading it during the semester, which I know is difficult. If you can&#x27;t, no big deal. Just make sure to be up do date when the midterm comes around and then catch up on it during reading period to prepare for the final. If you are consistent every week with doing your psets in office hours, read each chapter of the text book (at least by the final), and do all the practice exams, you are in a great position to do well in the course! Good luck!</td>

Much more conceptually confusing. Problem sets take so. long. so start as early as you can. Would not recommend taking this at the same time as another really hard class, which is something I learned the hard way. Lectures are not very effective at all, the professors often just rambled and it was really unclear how you would actually use the content they discussed until you actually used it in the problem sets.
