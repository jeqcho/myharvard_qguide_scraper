My section TF, Jio, knew the answers to all of our questions and was very helpful when studying for exams. One tip is that the exams truly look exactly like the practice exams and section questions, and you need to make your answer match the given answer keys for those questions exactly to get maximum points — don&#x27;t try to get creative in this course.</td>

I did not have that much background going into it either. I took Chem (not AP) in highschool and LS1a and that was really all the chem I had ever done. The class it set up really poorly. The lab part of the class sucks. Lab quizzes are ridiculous and graded so harshly and, also on that note the tests are also graded so harshly like you can get questions 100% correct and they&#x27;ll still find a way to take off like 99% of the points. The actual labs themselves are fine and I liked my TF, but they&#x27;re really long and are only tangentially related to what were actually learning. I loved the section part of the class, it was definitely my favorite part. I just showed up and learned the stuff they tried to teach in lecture and did practice problems. Good times. The lectures were also alright but they really do rush through stuff and you don&#x27;t really get it the first time. That was fine though, especially since there was section to make up for that. I will admit, the class was super rewarding. I really did learn a ton. Three midterm exams and a final exam is crazy though, but I guess that&#x27;s just a STEM course. All in all, I guess I&#x27;d recommend it, but if you had asked me mid&ndash;semester I would&#x27;ve told you the opposite.</td>

It&#x27;s one of the hardest classes here.<br/><br/>If you got an A in LS1a, LS1b, and PS11, and thought you worked hard &ndash;&ndash; get ready for orgo.<br/><br/>Orgo is completely different. As someone who was great at science, I found myself easily learning Ls1a and Ls1b, getting As in the class without really paying attention in lecture, and then cramming 2&ndash;3 days before exams by grinding through practice problems until I developed an intuition.<br/><br/>You may NEVER develop this intuition for orgo. The only solution to this is to immerse yourself so deeply in the subject.<br/><br/>It sounds odd &ndash;&ndash; and you&#x27;re probably thinking about enrolling in this course for premed requirements, and are about to ignore my comment. However, listen carefully.<br/><br/>Office hours are not very helpful. The only thing that helps is doing EVERY module problem that they give you 2&ndash;3 times before exams. This requires a week of studying BEFORE midterms, and 2&ndash;3 weeks of studying before the final. It&#x27;s insane but you have to do it if you want an A.<br/><br/>At Harvard, you&#x27;re competing against geniuses who took Orgo in high school as well as other extremely talented students.<br/><br/>You end with a basis of organic chemistry, however, most of the material covered in class doesn&#x27;t align with the MCAT. We didn&#x27;t learn much of the material on the MCAT + those questions are asked differently. Because most students are premed here, this course is less effective than PS11, PS2, etc. that cater most content towards premed. Chem majors can take Chem 10, 20, 30, etc.<br/><br/>Overall, you&#x27;ll probably take this course anyway because you&#x27;re premed, in which case, good luck but be ready to dedicate a serious 10&ndash;12 hours even if you found yourself at the top of LS1a, Ls1b, etc. I was at the top of those classes, yet miserably failed in Orgo.</td>

You should do all the practice you can; make use of those 15 pages of practice problems that are attached to section handouts. I love Sirinya and Christina though, they are great lecturers and they guide you through each and every step of the way!! <br/><br/>In terms of class structure, I think Chem 17 is pretty well&ndash;structured, but also very intense (similar to other intro chem course here). Expect yourself to be in lecture, 3&ndash;hour long labs plus section. Labs are pretty long and intense, although you do get to do actual chemistry which is fun!! Highly suggest avoiding night lab if you can, you&#x27;ll get out at 9pm dead :(</td>

The actual content is super cool. Lectures are fun. PSETS can be tough if you don&#x27;t go to office hours and work with others, but if you do, they are fine and graded in a helpful way. Prepare in advance for exams by studying the material after each lecture and taking a practice exam as soon as they are released. Then build a study schedule based off of what areas are your weaknesses. YOU GOT IT</td>

CHEM17 taught me that I’m capable of digesting more content in a semester than I thought I was able to, but man was this class so hard because of how fast paced it was. More so if you’re taking MCB60 at the same time. I don’t care if admin schedules their exams so close together for weeding out purposes, that overlap made this class so much harder than it needed to be and should be fixed immediately. CHEM17 goes from zero to a hundred really fast after the first midterm. Grading is incredibly tough, so securing an A&ndash;&#x2F;A ultimately comes down to not missing small details. Exams are similar to practice exams. Labs are actual labs, not like PS11. Final words of advice: Memorize early, prioritize active learning, form good PSET groups, and seriously don’t be afraid to ask questions (you’ll regret not doing it later).</td>

It&#x27;s too busy, and you barely get any questions without someone else barging in and asking the TF. I recommend finding a group of people or friends to check psets with instead.<br/>2) Review the lecture slides early if possible. Even skimming and writing notes relieves some of the stress during the lecture since you at least looked over them. <br/>3) Do section problems as soon as you get them. This class is not about memorization (besides functional groups, but if you practice more with them, you eventually. memorize them), and it&#x27;s all about learning through practicing. I would go through the problems with no notes (like actually struggling through them) and then review the answer keys and correct anything you did wrong. Then a few days later or before a midterm, erase your work and do the problems again. I would do these for practice exams, too.

Try not to fall behind &ndash; since the class moves so fast and builds on itself, as soon as you start to fall behind, the material really compounds and makes it difficult to catch up. Sirinya and Christina are great and very accessible during lecture, and the helprooms are not too overcrowded so they are pretty good &ndash; the only drawback is that some members of the course staff are a lot better at explaining the concepts than others.

You may find yourself waiting a long time to ask about what seems like an exception to a mechanism, only to learn that it&#x27;s a mistake in the answer key.) <br/><br/>&ndash; Despite the fact that the course staff make mistakes on course materials, you are not allowed to: As there is no exam drop and exams are worth 75% of your grade, each exam is high stakes. If you mess up any one of the three midterms or finals, it can hurt your grade significantly. Please study answer keys carefully, as you will lose points for mistakes that seem small (e.g. what type of arrow you are drawing, how you are depicting your chiral center), and these mistakes will add up quickly and significantly impact your grade. I knew several peers who did poorly on midterm one or two, got very high scores on the rest, but still had to spend the rest of the semester extremely stressed about this course and ended up with below an A.<br/><br/>Overall, I would recommend taking S&ndash;17 (the summer course) instead if it is at all possible for you. Though Fall 2023 Chem 17&#x27;s may have been better taught and graded than S&ndash;17, I believe that S&ndash;17 will be much better for your GPA if future semesters of Chem 17 are anything like this one. The teaching is no longer as good, and neither is the grading.</td>

That being said, this course is absolutely doable (I took it with MCB 60 too). The teaching staff are great and are very open to questions. What worked for me was going to the Help Rooms; it&#x27;s certainly time consuming, and while it does not yield much for the pset grades themselves (due to how generously they&#x27;re) graded, they are incredibly helpful for making sure you understand the material.<br/><br/>Don&#x27;t approach this course as you would some other STEM courses (like LS1a&#x2F;b, PS11). Memorization is certainly needed, and being able to recognize and solve problems is obviously important. However, I think what most matters is actually understanding how and why things work as they do. This was my first organic chemistry course, and my chemistry background knowledge was essentially from LS1a and PS11. However, I was able to get a lot from this course and do well in it.<br/><br/>As long as you study hard and seek help, you will do well! :)</td>

I&#x27;ll start by saying that I am coming away from the class liking organic chemistry, and it&#x27;s a unique experience from other classes where you get to sit down and basically do puzzles with drawings for the psets.  Both Sirinya and Christina are fun in their own ways, and I also had a great section leader.  The materials provided can be really helpful for practice as well.  I&#x27;ll also say that the course staff are often cognizant of how challenging the material can be: there&#x27;s a relatively lenient pset policy regarding grade cutoffs and they mass&ndash;changed one pre&ndash;lab quiz grade due to how difficult it was.<br/><br/>The pset policy, however, is much needed; it&#x27;s likely on your pset that if you deviate from the chemical reasoning mentioned briefly in lecture you will get no points for that question.  You could also probably miss half of the point value for a 10&ndash;step mechanism question by occasionally missing electron movement on proton transfers.  Maybe it&#x27;s the culture of organic chemists, but they can be quite strict with what yields points.  I also think that chemical reasoning in general can be quite hand&ndash;wavy (especially with Chem 17 being a gateway course), and I&#x27;ve heard of different standards being used for things like ranking molecular orbital energies for different classes.  These differences can be frustrating for getting a clear answer.<br/><br/>Overall, I think I still had a good experience in Chem 17, and while I did put in a good amount of work I got a lot out too.  If you&#x27;re a life science concentrator who has to take it, there&#x27;s definitely ways to make it fun (especially with friends).</td>

Lock in, make sure you set aside time to UNDERSTAND the concepts you learn in class; you cannot cram for this class unless you&#x27;re a prodigy or a chem concentrator.

However, I think this class was actually not terrible and the content is pretty interesting if you put in the effort to keep up. The Psets were difficult, but the 75+ giving full credit takes off a lot of stress and makes it a bit easier to learn the content since you can focus on the topics more than the grades. Exams were hard, but if you put in the time and study you will be okay. A large part of the battle was just figuring out the best way to learn the material and then doing a lot of practice problems. Lab was unnecessarily annoying because the pre&ndash;labs and lab reports took way too much time and effort. Sirinya and Christina are both pretty good lecturers, but Christina goes a bit fast.

There is so much content and nuances to remember for every exam, but the teaching staff does an amazing job at helping you understand the material well.

I took this class with Neuro 80, which I found to not be too difficult.<br/><br/>The teaching staff is great and very accessible. In other classes like LPSA and PS11 I didn&#x27;t really work with or get to know the teaching team. However, it was a huge advantage in this class to get help from the team.

Although 2+ hours may seem like a waste of studying time, I can confidently say it helps to be there. I did significantly better on the 2 exams that I went to the review for, and did didn&#x27;t do great on the midterm I didn&#x27;t attend the review for. You can ask live questions and use it like a helproom afterwards.<br/>&ndash; Start studying at least one week in advance for the exams. You need time to sit with the material and let it sink in. It&#x27;s definitely not something you can cram for.<br/>&ndash; Exam 2 was my worst exam. Watch out for that one because the material really ramps up with longer mechanisms and stereochemistry. <br/>&ndash; If an exam doesn&#x27;t go well, change your strategy. I made a significant improvement between Exam 2 and 3 because I stopped trying to memorize mechanisms and started building an intuition by doing plenty of practice. <br/>&ndash; Start the psets on your own before going to helproom. The whole key to success is struggling with the material on your own first to really learn from it.<br/>&ndash; Go to at least 2 helprooms a week. I usually went Thursday night with CAs and Friday afternoon with the instructors. It&#x27;s a big relief to finish the pset before the weekend and then go to helproom on Sat or Sun if you have any questions about the content. <br/>&ndash; Something I wish I did was review material after each lecture.

It&#x27;s really difficult. However, it is doable if you manage your time well. The PSETs aren&#x27;t too bad because, as of Fall 2024, they round up each PSET score to the nearest 25%&ndash;&ndash;so if you score greater than 75%, it rounds up to 100%. The exams are more problematic because of the sheer amount of content in each module, and also because the reactions on exams are often considerably more complex than what is covered in lecture. You will do well if you review all PSET, section and practice problems,  but you will also likely end up overpreparing because the practice problems are necessary to prep for the exam but also tend to go a bit overboard. Definitely start studying for the exams&ndash;&ndash;especially the final&ndash;&ndash;early.  Lastly, check your exam scores carefully&ndash;&ndash;I had a lot of grading mistakes on my 3rd midterm, but they will fix them if you submit regrade requests.</td>

Attend office hours, build relationships with your TF, ask the professors questions, and do all of the practice problems.

But what’s special about Chem 17 is that there is more emphasis on understanding the chemistry rather than rote memorization…and I loved that.<br/>Success in orgo relies on one thing: Practice, Practice, and PRACTICE!<br/>You need to become familiar and comfortable with the material by exposing yourself to the concepts regularly since everything builds on one another. <br/>What I love about CHEM 17 is that they provide plenty of study material to master the content. The best way to prepare for the exam is through lots of practice. During section, you are given a packet for each module that consists of workshop problems (which are completed during section), practice problems, and challenge problems. Make sure you work through all the problems in the packet and that you understand the problems and process for solving them. Something I did was keep a bank of reflections on questions I had trouble on in a Google Doc to then address to CAs or TFs for clarification. This helped me think through the methodologies behind the solutions to each problem. Also, since this course is based on mechanisms, it would be helpful to keep a “recipe book” for every mechanism you learn in class (starting materials, reagents, products, etc.). This was especially helpful when studying for the final.<br/>Most importantly, always ask questions. Orgo will always be a difficult class, but it’s even more difficult when you don’t ask for help or clarification. The teaching team is very helpful and wants to see you succeed!

They will never give the average, but always say the class did well so you can never really know how you&#x27;re actually performing. The TFs and professors are not remotely close to being as strong as the other teaching staff in other STEM introductory courses or pre&ndash;med requirements (LS1A&#x2F;LPSA&#x2F;LS1B&#x2F;PS11).

We often didn&#x27;t get practice exams until very last second, notation would be inconsistent between lectures and answer keys, and answer keys for practice tests and modules often got changed last second (like...the night before the exam) after people noticed mistakes and emailed about them (so we would be trying to study off of the wrong thing).

Also, if you can, you will understand the content so much better if you do those every week after section, and then do your PSET as like a test. Have a lighter workload with your other courses (this + one other STEM course is the max). Stereochem is soooo rough so really try to understand it in mechanisms as soon as you learn because trying to understand that when the exam comes is like last of your priorities but you will lose so many marks if you don&#x27;t do it right.

If you approach this course with the intent on memorizing, you are not going to do well or will be wasting a lot of time, so my best advice is to try and understand things conceptually and start to see broader patterns (especially with mechanisms)! This will save you a lot of time in later units when the number of mechanisms you need to know start going through the roof.  The midterms get progressively more difficult as well in terms of the content you need to know and they definitely build off of each other. To prepare yourself for the midterms, I highly recommend you redo all of the section problems and then do the practice exams and spend the last day reviewing all of the previous problems. Additionally, try and make a cheat sheet for yourself for each midterm (only cover the absolute essentials — lecture slides have a lot of fluff) that have all of the mechanisms on there under each condition, variation, etc. This came in really handy when studying for the final as well. The class as a whole is very fair and well run, but I think these tips will definitely help you get through the class</td>

This is all coming from someone who actually did good in the course! Like if I have problems with it, then y&#x27;all know that there must be something wrong with this course. I have a whole list of complaints about this course that everybody needs to know before signing up blindly to take orgo.<br/><br/>1) This course is so incredibly disorganized. From the order in which we learn content to the actual homework assignments and lab grades, this course is so all over the place and that does not help us at all especially because the content is so hard. For the first exam, they blindly teach you mechanisms about things that you don&#x27;t fully learn about until literally the last week of class. Like it makes no sense the order of the content that they teach us because it seems like we have to walk into this course knowing organic chemistry (which by the way is how they teach it to you), which is not the case at all. How can I go into a lecture hall and sit there the entire time being confused because the professor **cough**Christina**cough** is going to zoom through every single slide just to get 30 of them in one lecture, but literally not take a single second to explain. If I am sitting there still trying to draw structures on a slide that is 2 slides back from what you&#x27;re currently on, YOU ARE GOING WAY TOO FAST AND NEED TO CALM DOWN BECAUSE WE DON&#x27;T KNOW ORGANIC CHEMISTRY. Additionally, the lab assignments and PSETs are so chaotic. They literally have PSETs that go up to version 7 because that is how many mistakes they made and overlooked! Yet then on PSETs and exams they grade you so harshly and show no mercy, but they are going to make mistakes such that they need 7 versions of PSETs? Like honestly please someone fix that. It was so frustrating for me because how can I learn the RIGHT way to do things if y&#x27;all are making mistakes right and left in this course.<br/><br/>2) The grading discrepancies are absolutely WILD. When I work on a lab assignment with my roommates and my lab partner, and all of us end up having the same results, but then my roommate (who have a different lab TF) get a 100%, while my lab partner and I get a 60%, I&#x27;m thinking there is an issue with that. That being said, please do not be afraid to ask for regrade requests and do not be afraid to be a little passive aggressive about why you think you&#x27;re right, because chances are you are right. But most importantly, how can the grading discrepancies among TFs be that different. This just goes to show that the course is not managed well, and there is not a stricter eye on grading and grading mistakes.<br/><br/>3) The PSETs are too long. If you get into 8 page PSETs, I think that&#x27;s pretty manageable, but when you start getting into 10+, even 14 page PSETs, you&#x27;ve gone too far! You expect us to do these PSETs on content that we barely know, and expect us to do lab assignments and study for the exams, it is crazy. CHEM17 IS NOT OUR ONLY COMMITMENT!!! I think that the course is structured so that you can do well if you only devote time to this course, but that is not the reality and it is frustrating.<br/><br/>All of this being said, there are some good things about this course. They do have a curve that will let an A&ndash; be as low as an 87%, and that threshold changes year to year. So that is nice, and there is an okay grading policy with the PSETs being if you get a 75% or better, it rounds up to a 100%, and of course one PSET drop. However, if you think that you get an exam drop like in LPSA, PS11, LS1B, etc., you are sadly mistaken and need to get that out of your mind right away, otherwise you will not prepare enough for these exams. It is virtually impossible to get an A in this class, and when people are averaging 30% on exams, I think that says it all about this course.</td>

Not only that, but there are frequent mistakes with psets and answer keys, which was pretty frustrating. I felt like I was confused on a number of topics because I got contradictory explanations from different people. We cover SO MUCH material every week, it&#x27;s insane. We never covered everything in section, even though we sped through everything that we did cover. I feel like there&#x27;s just too much that we learn, so you HAVE TO stay on top of it.

The pacing is reasonable and the course schedule is very organized which is helpful. My biggest tip would be to do problem sets on your own because it forces you to make sure you have a solid understanding of the content in a low risk setting (over a 75 is counted as 100% in this class). One thing you&#x27;ll hear a lot of people say is to do the section practice problems, and it is for a reason!!! Lastly, it helped me to create a list of all concepts with my condensed explanations as well as problems I got wrong on my first try. I consistently revisited this list and added to it, and it really helped me a lot in preparing for exams! <br/><br/>**for section problems: sometimes they are not as thorough in creating the right types of questions for section practice because it&#x27;s lower stakes. If a TF or CA tells you that you likely won&#x27;t have to worry about a certain type of problem for an exam, you should just make sure to understand what larger concept the problem was trying to test you on and MOVE ON! There are too many details to care about so save your time and energy on the ones that actually matter!<br/><br/>If Anton Ni is still one of the TF&#x27;s in the future he is extremely really helpful!!! He is an actual genius and has arguably the most solid technical understanding of chemistry in general so you can definitely count on him to provide the most ACCURATE answers :)</td>

The teaching team is amazing and the course is well&ndash;ordered &ndash; it&#x27;s very supportive and there are so many resources to get help. It&#x27;s very manageable if you spend time and are interested in learning these concepts, considering orgo is not an easy class in general.</td>

Don&#x27;t get discouraged by people saying it&#x27;s really hard, because you can absolutely succeed if you make sure to keep up with the content week by week. Do all the practice problems and study hard for the exams; they are fair but difficult and really test your understanding. If you can answer ALL the pset problems and practice problems, you will do totally fine on the exams, but don&#x27;t skip any problems and make sure you can explain every step.</td>
