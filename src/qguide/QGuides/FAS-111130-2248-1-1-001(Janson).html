The actual course content is fairly difficult, but its very reasonable to understand the main ideas especially thanks to the clear presentation of material. <br/><br/>My problems with this course are the problem sets and exams:<br/><br/>The problem sets are extremely long, with multiple questions often relying on unintuitive constructions and involving long computations. <br/><br/>The worst part about this class is the midterm (and the same comments hold for the final). Before the midterm, I felt like I had a fair grasp of the course content because I worked through most of the problem sets alone and did all of the practice questions for the midterm, but I found the midterm (especially the first question) extremely difficult to even make partial progress on. After a certain point, I didn&#x27;t feel like I was learning anything from doing the midterm questions, and was just trying to write down anything I could to earn some partial credit. Because of this, the midterm was an extremely demoralizing experience. The grading of the exam also felt extremely arbitrary and artificial, with the aim of obtaining an approximately normal distribution with a predetermined mean and variance. In particular, the first question was graded very leniently, whereas the second question was graded extremely harshly with very little partial credit for complete solutions that did not respect some vague (and not specified) conditions.</td>

My favorite parts were probably our section sufficiency and the asymptotic Normality of the MLE; it&#x27;s very cool to see a proof for this very foundational result. But I hope you *really* like hypothesis tests because otherwise a majority of the class (and in our case, both exams) will probably not be that interesting to you. Lucas is very nice and approachable though, highly recommend stopping by his office hours to chat.</td>

			<td class="TabularBody_LeftColumn" headers="comment-2_bca6d2cb-0671-496b-aca7-23c8d1bf57ff">Lectures are interesting, clear and engaging.  Prof. Janson poses small questions to the class a few times each lecture, which have helped me engage with the material more actively.  He also provides great intuition alongside rigorous proofs.  (I particularly appreciate his picture illustrating the correspondence between Bayes rules and admissible rules.)<br/><br/>The problem sets are brilliant.  For instance, some problems require us to understand the details of a proof and not just the final result.  Some of the results in the problem sets are quite surprising and beautiful.<br/><br/>While I don&#x27;t think the exams are a great metric of what one learned in the course (as they greatly emphasize innate intelligence and mathematical skill), the exam problems were fun and interesting (and very hard).</td>

I think this is a fair baseline. The modifications I would make to this are, starting with the good: 1) Lucas Janson does a pretty good job of giving motivation for concepts, making the lectures worth attending; 2) exams are now 16&ndash;hours long and online &ndash; this makes them much more doable since you can go for a walk or eat lunch in the middle without worrying about every minute, but it is still incredibly exhausting. Next, the bad, mostly that the psets seem incredibly unmotivated, with convoluted results that are mathematically sound but are neither interesting nor applicable, and with odd degrees of rigor in the sense that measure theory is hand&ndash;waved but some other tiny details are rigorously enforced. Overall much better than I expected in the sense that I came in with rock&ndash;bottom expectations and only took this course (and still would only take this course) for the AB&#x2F;SM, but still felt that the lectures were interesting.</td>

			<td class="TabularBody_LeftColumn" headers="comment-2_bca6d2cb-0671-496b-aca7-23c8d1bf57ff">I think it is fair to say that this was the best course I have taken at Harvard. The teaching is impeccable; Prof. Janson knows everything about the subject and much more. The lecture notes are excellent, but I highly recommend attending the lectures because the teaching is outstanding. This course is not only a challenging Statistics course but also a demanding Mathematics course. The homework assignments are difficult and very time&ndash;consuming. The exams are probably the hardest and most stressful I’ve encountered in a long time (nothing comparable to any other exam at Harvard).<br/><br/>However, I cannot express enough how much I learned and how much I enjoyed the material. Note that Prof. Janson will almost certainly not be teaching this course next fall, so this feedback might not be as relevant if the homework and exams change. Unfortunately, the first few weeks are not particularly challenging, so shopping for this course might not give an accurate sense of its difficulty. If you are ready for a significant challenge, this is the course for you.<br/><br/>The good news: after completing this course, you will have learned a lot, and with high probability, you’ll never take something this intense again.</td>

I got a great grade in the class because of my skillful usage of ChatGPT. While others in this qguide report might claim that you should only take this class if you have a crazy math background (like IMO), I&#x27;m here to tell you that OpenAI will make chatbots that will get better and better at solving the exam problems, beating out the people who do have crazy backgrounds. The playing ground is effectively level. Thus, I encourage everyone to take this class; it is a free 4.0 as long as you are a skillful prompt engineer (which you can be with enough hard work)!<br/><br/>On the other hand, I also find it really funny that my ChatGPT responses got similar scores to people who actually tried. Maybe the graders should think a bit deeper about student solutions and see if they actually know what&#x27;s going on. In particular, if the course staff only makes simple 0&ndash;1 judgements on their rubrics, my low effort responses get the same scores as people who actually spent nontrivial time thinking about the problems.<br/><br/>I don&#x27;t see this class changing anytime soon, so please take it! It is probably the class in this whole school with the highest perceived difficulty&#x2F;actual effort ratio if you use the right strategies.</td>

			<td class="TabularBody_LeftColumn" headers="comment-2_bca6d2cb-0671-496b-aca7-23c8d1bf57ff">This was a very interesting (and also challenging) class! <br/><br/>Content:<br/><br/>The content of this course is pretty solid and interesting. The first half of the class is relatively easy and covers classical material in Lehmann&ndash;Casella (Theory of Point Estimation). For instance, basic concepts such as the MLE, (minimal&#x2F;complete&#x2F;) sufficient statistics, UMVUEs, Lehmann&ndash;Scheffe, Basu’s theorem, consistency + asymptotic normality of the MLE are introduced and proven. The mathematical rigor is held at a level where mathematical expressions are calculated and theorems are proven properly, with the exception of measure theory, which is wholly ignored. In general, this part of the material is pretty clean (with some occasional Taylor expansion bashes), but motivated and interesting. As a note on measure theory, I think it is fine to avoid this in class (because the goal is to teach inference, not mathematics), but it would be nice to have a reference which one can consult for fully mathematically rigorous proofs.<br/><br/>The second half is more conceptually difficult. It covers classical hypothesis testing (Neyman&ndash;Pearson, mixed tests, p&ndash;values, sign&#x2F;sign&ndash;rank&#x2F;permutation tests, asymptotic tests, etc.). Prof. Janson then discusses selective inference, which is the basis of more modern research. The rough idea is that one wants to avoid p&ndash;hacking type of results, where one tests many hundreds of hypotheses; therefore, one wants guarantees on quantities such as the false discovery rate (FDR) or the familywise error rate (FWER), both errors based on the number of false rejections. There are some interesting combinatorial&ndash;type problems here, and the bounding methods are more conceptual. Then confidence intervals and their relationship with hypothesis tests are discussed; lastly, a brief excursion into Bayesian inference and decision theory is covered. This last part is relatively simple, because much of the difficulty in Bayesian inference comes from the computational aspect (cf: stat 220 as a class which teaches this well). The decision theory part is pretty cool and worth looking at; the complete class theorem is proven.<br/><br/>Overall, the material is definitely interesting and worth learning, as it forms the foundation for any work or understanding of statistics and inference.<br/><br/>Note on Prerequisites:<br/><br/>Understanding of material from stat110&#x2F;210 should be enough. It is good to know the material in stat111, because this class is relatively theoretical, and familiarity and exposure of the basic ideas in 111 beforehand will allow the concepts taught in 211 to be better put in perspective. <br/><br/>Course Notes + Lectures:<br/><br/>The course notes are very well&ndash;written, probably one of the better sets of course notes. Lectures largely go directly off the notes. There is also a ‘recent paper about the topic’ at the end of each small section; these are interesting and give more context to modern research, as this is a graduate course.<br/><br/>Grading:<br/><br/>The grading for this class was somewhat odd and, at times, fairly unreasonable; hence the reason for this (unusual and extra) remark. In fairness, grading a large quantity of extremely ugly proofs (which are unavoidable in a class with an abundance of Taylor expansions) is a difficult task, and understandably there will be occurrences of both errors and personal decisions of the grader which may differ from the understanding of the student. However, I feel that there are several instances where the class grading actively hindered the pedagogical ideology of the course. I will provide an elaboration below. <br/><br/>Mainly, it was not obvious what details to place. The main contribution of stat211, in my view, is a course to learn important ideas in statistical inference, with an acceptable level of rigor. Here, “acceptable” is up to interpretation; however, the lack of inclusion of measure theoretic rigor is a good place to start. In my view, a reasonable sense of rigor is provided by Lucas’s lecturing: the mathematical calculations are written out, while the abstract and long mathematical (such as measure theoretic) details may be avoided. However, in the grading, significant emphasis was often placed on very minor details. For instance, forgetting to cite “uncorrelated =&gt; independent”, which is a very standard fact in stat210, was the cause of deducting 2&#x2F;5 (40%) of points on a problem. There are many other instances of minor typos or omitting relatively simple details being worth an undue percentage of points for the problem (at least 20+%), which I feel like detracts from the ideology of the course. <br/><br/>Exams:<br/><br/>The exams are quite tough, though actually pretty fun. There are 2 problems in both the midterm and the final, which constitutes around 55% of your grade. The problems are actually pretty interesting, and are often motivated by various modern research papers; therefore, the questions being asked are natural. It is probably one of the few instances of exams at Harvard which are genuinely challenging and also provide intellectual value on their own. They are also 16 hours long, so be prepared to spend one long day doing nothing else. <br/><br/>On the other hand, I do have two comments on this structure. First, I think it would be nice to include more than exactly 4 total problems in both exams. Mostly, the consequence of having only 4 problems is that it is literally impossible to have exams which cover a majority of material in the course; for instance, this year, there were 0 exam problems relating to the last two sections of the course (Bayesian methods and decision theory). While there were HW problems on these topics, it would have been nice to have a slightly more cumulative exam. Given around 10&ndash;ish sections total, I think even adding 1 more problem per exam and having some problems encompass 2 sections is sufficient. <br/><br/>Second, I appreciate the exams for having intriguing ideas; along these lines, however, it is forced to be relatively open&ndash;ended. This resulted in the following issue: problems would sometimes include lines such as, “provide a test satisfying conditions X and Y. Better tests will receive more marks, as long as they all satisfy X and Y”. As a result, it was often unclear whether solutions would receive full points; for instance, it was possible to have a completely correct solution satisfying X and Y and which was morally correct (i.e. accomplished the main task), but did not receive full credit. <br/>While this was generally fine and didn’t have a major impact on grades (which were generally 0+ or 50&ndash; anyway), it made it relatively painful whenever one was done with the problems, since one would have to sit the rest of the 16 hours while not being fully certain about the status of their solutions. Moreover, it was annoying to see that solutions which seemed completely correct ended up losing points. While the point deduction may be justified (indeed, there were better solutions available!), it would be nice to have an additional line, just stating what exact level of precision is required. I think that often times, students who would have been able to figure out the full&ndash;credit solution end up not doing so, not because of a lack of understanding of material, but rather because they believe their solution is already fully correct.<br/>Examples from this year’s exams (which should be posted in exam review by next year): (1) there was a problem where making extra assumptions caused the deduction of between 7&ndash;10 out of 50 points. This is reasonably justified, because the problem states that they prefer as weak additional assumptions as possible, and it is possible to make none at all. Nonetheless, an   <br/>(2) there was a problem where a slightly weaker test did not merit full points. This felt a bit impossible to guess; in particular, the given solution was the optimal test, but the weaker test also had power approaching 1 with exponential tails. In the exam, it didn’t really feel obvious at all that the weaker test was even “weak”, and I feel like some indication towards this on the exam would’ve been appreciated. <br/><br/>Notes for the interested student:<br/><br/>I would encourage you to take the class! In terms of learning the material, reading the notes or going to lecture are both sufficient. If you do not want to take 16&ndash;hour exams, and if the exam style remains the same, I think it could also be advised (depending on your schedule) to audit the class, because in my view the material can be learned to sufficient depth just by reading the notes, and perhaps doing some of the more informative HW problems.</td>

Lucas is a great lecturer who is very clear and obviously understands his contents deeply, often giving lots of geometric intuitions to supplement the lecture notes, albeit a bit cold and robotic. The homework is difficult but doable, every problem set has some super bashy and some decently pretty questions. The midterm and the final are quite insanely difficult but the grading seems to be somewhat generous. The material itself I think is quite crucial and beautiful to understand, at the same time a nice review of 110, 111, 210 concepts. If you are even considering taking this course reading this Q guide, you should probably just take it. Thank you for a content packed semester Lucas and I am grateful for my pset buddies. Happy New Year!</td>

			<td class="TabularBody_LeftColumn" headers="comment-2_bca6d2cb-0671-496b-aca7-23c8d1bf57ff">The story of Statistics 211 is very interesting. If you are an undergrad who is seriously considering the course, it is likely that you are either pursuing the concurrent AM degree in Statistics, or have some other interest in classical frequentist statistical inference, so my response will assume that you will enroll in the course regardless of what I say and instead aim to prepare you for the semester in which you take it. As a result, I will not discuss the course content at length. However, if your motivation for considering the course is not one that I have listed, my recommendation is to stop reading these reviews and instead pick a set of courses that interest you. Note that since I took the course in Fall 2024, many of my comments are directly relevant to the teaching staff of the course in that semester; the professor was Lucas Janson and the course assistants were Kevin Du, Kenneth Gu, and Yuanchuan Guo. For those readers who are skimming the reviews, the course was enjoyable albeit somewhat time&ndash;intensive; for those readers who are interested in learning more about the experience, please refer to the below commentary.<br/><br/>First, the positives. As an introductory course in statistical inference, the topics covered must necessarily be accessible to students without a robust mathematical background. In particular, the professor explicitly states that no knowledge of measure theory is assumed, and none of the results in the course are &quot;proven&quot; using such techniques. Thus there are many simplifying assumptions made in lecture that sacrifice rigor for statistical intuition. For instance, though many statistical models of interest are neither discrete nor continuous, this fact is often swept under the rug although a truly rigorous treatment demands the use of measure. Some students who hail from the school of mathematics may view this practice negatively, but since I believe that grasping the big ideas matters far more than bumbling around in the weeds when one is first learning an important and difficult subject, it is fine with me. The course extends on this general goal by providing a set of reasonably detailed lecture notes that closely mirror the content and rigor of material presented in lecture; it is entirely possible to learn the material to the standard the professor requires by reading carefully through the notes and giving all of the pencil problems an honest attempt. For those who have not seen pencil problems before, they are short practice problems, often requiring more thinking than computation, that the professor will sometimes pose during lecture and give the class a short interval of time to consider before reviewing. According to the teaching staff, these notes have been revised and passed down through many iterations of the course (taught by Carl Morris, Joe Blitzstein, Tirthankar Dasgupta, Lucas Janson in chronological order) so their quality is well&ndash;assured. Some other classes have lecture notes or companion textbooks, but these are especially recommended because of their clarity and adherence to lecture content. Lucas also provides a detailed schedule of topics in his syllabus, so when reading the notes to review material it is easy to see how much is left to learn to be up to date. One might argue that having such a comprehensive set of notes would decrease the incentive for students to attend lecture especially since my iteration of the course had lectures at 9am on Mondays and Wednesdays which is not a favorable time for sleepy university students, but Lucas posts them sequentially as he covers the material. In fact, attending lecture on a regular basis is a definite benefit in this course because Lucas delivers the material with clarity and poise, so you will rarely become irreparably confused, conditioned on the event that you are awake and have been actively engaging with the material. Some may argue that he adheres too closely to the lecture notes, but given that he is the most recent author of the notes and they provide a lot of motivation, this is actually more of a pro than a con. Moreover, he has a feedback form at the end of each lecture that students are encouraged to fill out; there students can request another passthrough of the material and he will most likely fulfill the request in the subsequent lecture. Generally I am extremely appreciative of this style of lecturing and material availability since for students who do not especially enjoy the professor&#x27;s delivery or for some reason must miss lecture, the course can still be learned; it is clear that Lucas cares a lot about his students learning the material and takes intentional measures to make the course accessible for everyone. In office hours, he will of course not give solutions to the homework (and indeed he should not), but often it is more than worth attending to discuss the ideas presented in lecture or homework and learn the perspective of a qualified statistician. For these reasons alone, although Lucas will not be teaching the course in Fall 2025, as long as the new professor is not absurdly bad (this will not be the case, given the high quality of the Harvard statistics department) it is more than worth taking.<br/><br/>Second, the gray area. In terms of workload, this course has five homework assignments and two exams, where in my year the weighting for cumulative numerical score was given by the following formula: (0.45 homework average, 0.25 midterm, 0.30 final). There are 48 late hours that can be used on homework assignments in case of emergency; to my knowledge, there is no intermediate cap on the number of late hours that one is allowed to use per assignment. Each homework is around five problems, each with several parts, and students are given approximately two weeks to complete each assignment from the day that it is released. In most cases, all of the material covered on the homework is presented in lecture by the time that the homework is released, so it is feasible to start working immediately if you have been properly following the pace of the course. Some might recommend that you do this since waiting until the last few days could leave rigor errors in your work, but if you are collaborating with classmates it is difficult to align everyone&#x27;s schedules so early; moreover, sometimes the problem statements are not worded very clearly, so it is more time&ndash;efficient to start later because the situation in which you have done a lot of work but misinterpreted the question should be avoided. In fact, for this reason the course of discussion is one of the few courses in which a delayed start strategy is close to optimal. Each of the homework assignments attempts to follow up on a set of concepts that has been presented in lecture, which in theory serves an appreciable pedagogical use because a deeper understanding of the material can be achieved, which may be especially valuable down the road for statistics learners since real&ndash;world settings probably do not permit nice assumptions. However, in practice the homework problems often take the form of &quot;relax assumption A and show that theorem B still holds&quot; or perhaps &quot;perform modification B to statistical testing procedure Y and show that it achieves the same guarantee as the original&quot; and other variants along those lines. Since the original results that the homework assignments will slightly amend and ask you to prove are probably all described to some reasonable depth in lecture (if this were not the case, the problems would go beyond the scope of the course), the method of solution that is endorsed by the staff frequently reduces to imitating the work that has already been performed in the lecture notes. The homework is therefore rather tedious to complete and especially tedious to write up; there is often more algebraic bashing than statistical insight. It would be more interesting for students if the course covered why these modifications and related generalizations work, but for this sort of explanation it is perhaps best to engage with the professor during office hours. Indeed, one of the strongest mixed feelings I have about this course is that the lectures are very elegant, and the results in the homework are as well to some extent, but the process by which one arrives at these conclusions is far from it. However, this is perhaps to be expected since statistical inference as a field often involves messy computation, and it should be noted that at the conclusion of every lecture, Lucas makes a respectable effort to impart deeper motivation by providing in the lecture notes references to modern statistical papers that cover related topics. These papers are interesting, at least judging from the ones that I briefly read, and students are not expected to know them, so if you are unsatisfied by the learning that the homework attempts to impart, you can read them at no cost. However, you probably do not care that much about the homework since most Harvard students spend a lot of time on their homework and do fairly well as a result. As I have been in your shoes, you likely care more about your letter grade, and thus you want to learn about the factor that determines the curve. You want to learn about the exams.<br/><br/>Third, the negatives. I will preface this section by saying that no course is perfect; in fact, Lucas has done a terrific job with the course this semester, which is consistent with what I have heard from students in previous years. As you read, please keep in mind that I will give only honest feedback that does not detract from my overall positive impression of the course. Now I will continue from where I paused earlier. The exams in Statistics 211 are take&ndash;home, and students are given 16 hours within a several&ndash;day window to complete them; the exams used to be 24 hours in length but were shortened. In my year, there was a midterm around the first week of November and a final around the start of finals week in December. Obviously, collaboration is not allowed. Each exam contains two proof&ndash;based problems, each of which contains anywhere from zero to several subparts. These are inherently difficult because you are permitted to use a wealth of time and the course materials; many students will spend multiple hours making minimal progress and will submit either complete solutions or completely incorrect attempts. The format of these exams introduces nontrivial stress since four problems determine your grade in the course, and even though there may be multiple parts to a problem, in my year the solutions required similar ideas so if you did not get the first part you were not likely to get the others. Evidently your performance on these exams can have high variance; note also that the course is mandatory for G1 Statistics PhD students who are incentivized to score well, so as an undergraduate receiving an A can be an arduous task. Before taking the exams, it is recommended that you spend considerable time reviewing the lecture notes as well as practice problems (homework and additional) that the professor gives, since knowing both the main ideas at a high level and how they may show up in problems goes a long way in solving the exam under stress. I am conflicted on whether having such long take&ndash;home exams is a good idea in principle, since one could make the argument that in a real research setting, progress is highly nonlinear and attempting problems with more time is a closer imitation than spending only a few hours in an exam room. Some other courses ask students to complete final projects instead of final exams, but that is not preferable to the current regime in Statistics 211 since the course material is very difficult to learn rigorously; most undergrads would not be able to conduct nontrivial research in their first semester covering it. In fact, the research setting interpretation of the exams may indeed be correct since in my year most of the problems were incredibly open&ndash;ended, with the problem statements saying that more points would be awarded to solutions that &quot;were better&quot; by a specified metric; in particular, one question asked students to make necessary assumptions and implied that correct solutions with weaker assumptions would receive more points, despite the course not covering what different approaches might look like. This is one obvious point of criticism. Anecdotally, there were several cases on exams in which student solutions that were comparable to the staff solution in rigor and correctness received substantial point deductions, and the given reason was that stated above. This grading scheme seems inherently flawed in that students cannot gauge whether their answer is satisfactory despite meeting the explicit requirements of the problem statement, and if one wants to assess genuine understanding of the material, it seems far more pedagogically valuable to award correct ideas that achieve slightly suboptimal statistical guarantees compared to the staff solution full or close&ndash;to&ndash;full credit, rather than deducting 1&#x2F;5 or more points, where other solutions with incorrect ideas or largely missing rigor are not deducted substantially more. Under this grading scheme where students are compared to the staff solution, one would expect that a student that achieves stronger guarantees than the staff solution should receive more than full marks; is such behavior reasonable? As an aside, a consequence of having only four problems on exams was that much of the content in the latter third of the course was not tested, including Bayesian inference and decision theory, but since a student who takes the course should be learning all of the material anyway, this is not major. The other remark I have is regarding the course staff aside from the professor; not all of the course assistants exhibited this behavior, but based on the language of the comments left on solutions, with extremely high probability there was a nonnegative number of course staff who consistently acted unreasonably (out of respect for individual privacy I will not give the true number). Reasonably often, points were deducted from homework (and exams, but I have already discussed this to an extent) for incorrect reasons. Often, the penalized solutions either exactly matched those given in the staff solutions or did not cite results that were shown and henceforth assumed to be true in previous courses that Statistics 211 assumes as a prerequisite. One example is &quot;uncorrelated implies independent in the Multivariate Normal setting&quot; which is proven in Statistics 210. Moreover, the graders did not always read the proofs correctly and would, upon receiving regrade requests, either change their minds or remain stubborn about the grading until the matter was brought to Lucas, who in all cases that I have seen, ended up giving the solution full credit. One of the course staff even repeatedly answered questions on Ed incorrectly to the point where Lucas had to issue corrections for each mistake. This sort of behavior is unbecoming of a graduate student in statistics and falls short of the usual high standard to which Harvard holds its statistics teaching, but it regrettably does happen sometimes; hopefully, students do not lose their passion for the material after experiencing such behavior. For me, the aforementioned positives outweighed, and I hope that you will find similar inspiration should you enroll.<br/><br/>Overall, this course was a highlight of my semester! If you are still reading, a few parting words. Learning a difficult subject well takes time; many nights, I grappled with assignments until after the sun rose. However, should you put in a consistent weekly body of effort, it is very fulfilling to emerge from the semester as a more confident and skilled statistician. In particular, the exams are difficult but worth the while since one seldom has the opportunity to make such a concentrated effort on engaging with the material. Good luck with your semester and have fun in the course!</td>

Digesting the lecture material alone is hard. But then having to apply the material on PSets and under exam pressure? Basically impossible. Find a good pset group or good luck buddy. <br/><br/>HOWEVER I will say despite its difficulty, this class has taught me more statistics than all of the stat classes I&#x27;ve taken combined. You think p&ndash;values are simple? WRONG. There is so much depth to these concepts taught in 110&#x2F;111 etc. that 211 really forces you to engage with. Janson is truly the GOAT and I thank the heavens that he is teaching this class. He is really good at explaining really complicated concepts in an intuitive manner, then building rigour around it so that concepts are always motivated and make sense in the bigger picture. <br/><br/>Advice to future students: 1. Don&#x27;t sweat your grade too much &ndash; the class is curved such that top 50% gets A&ndash;range, everyone else gets B&ndash;range, and only very few outliers (&lt; 5 presumably) get below that (I think). Try to focus on the learning because that will probably be stressful enough. 2. Believe in yourself. This class has a bit of a reputation and I can tell you that it does live up to it. But if you&#x27;ve gotten here you are definitely capable of making it through the class, so give it your best shot. I started off telling myself I was too dumb for the class but I think I would have gotten more learning out of it if I had approached with a more positive attitude.</td>

K. Rowling). Since my bright&ndash;eyed, bushy&ndash;tailed days as a freshman, I have been aspiring to discover what truly made this correspondence accurate. Is it the archaic&ndash;style of the architecture found in the Yard or in Annenberg? Is it the talent and passion of the many professors, lecturers and students? Is it the things people go on to achieve after leaving each respective institution? Is it the comradery and friendships that are nurtured within the school environment and the boarding house system? All of these are certainly candidates for that which we seek, but I alas decided that none of these really nailed home the conjecture I was attempting to prove. In vain, I hence abandoned my quest. However, little did I know, coming into my junior fall, that the needle in the haystack was not only going to reveal itself, but boisterously become a defining feature of my semester &ndash; ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls: I present to you (drumroll, please) &#x27;Wizardry 211: Black Magic with Probability Distributions&#x27;.<br/>	`Wait a second, that isn&#x27;t the title of the course? What happened to &quot;Stat 211: Statistical Inference I&quot; ?&#x27; you may ask. Well, that is part of the trap, because this is precisely what the course wants you to think it is. It commences unassumingly, with a beautiful first lecture on statistical philosophy and the inferential framework; the first few lectures continue on relatively unassumingly, with excellent motivation and intuition provided in class and beautiful results covered. Then the first problem set lands and you realise the true form of the evil in front of you, and from then on you realise that you are better off trying to purchase the Mirror of Erised to survive the assignments than trying to do them in any reasonable conventional manner (including nitpicking AI generated answers, as helpfully pointed out by Professor Janson). To explain a little bit &ndash; maybe it is just the nature of statistical inference research, but a very large number of problems in this course involve a &#x27;come up with a ... that satisfies (insert laundry list) of properties and accomplishes ... task&#x27; with very few clues from the lectures, lecture notes or texts that give you a starting point or intuitions on where to proceed with this type of problem, so when you are left to your devices and expected to find out from the (often vague) prompt what exactly it is you have to do it could often feel like you are tasked with performing black magic. Like any good school of magic, Hogwarts has over the years perfected a rigorous curriculum to train its students in various forms of magic, and of course has OWL and NEWT exams in subjects such as Potions (Stat 110), Charms (Stat 111) and even Defence in the Dark Arts (Stat 210) to prepare young wizards and witches from taking on real&ndash;world threats &ndash; it just unfortunately happens to be the case here that taking on the Stat 211 exams right after successful completion of these three courses is akin to what one would feel like battling Lord Voldemort and his army of Death Eaters fresh out of your NEWTS &ndash; while it is the case that there are a few Harry Potters around in the course that are able to survive this monumental task unscathed, there are many who have prepared and understood the content well who horribly fall victim to this terrible slaughtering. I&#x27;m all for difficult courses that make you work hard, but I am sure that many would agree that whilst this might be reflective of what statistical inference research feels like, this is not an appropriate way to design assignments and assess students&#x27; understanding of material.<br/>	That being said, this was one of my favourite classes at this school and the best statistics class I have ever taken. Professor Janson is a phenomenal lecturer who teaches with great clarity and rhythm. His lecture notes are equally excellent with a lot of great motivation and intuition given for understanding the tools the class develops and I think coming out of this I finally understood the logical framework of the subject of inference and the big picture of what it is trying to do (in contrast to the absolute mess that was Stat 111 lecture and textbook, absolute night and day difference). I really enjoyed all the topics in the course, but I thought the most well&ndash;taught were the areas of non&ndash;parametric hypothesis testing and selective inference which I found to have the most interesting and far&ndash;reaching consequences; the technicality and rigour was definitely there but not overbearing which was nice as it allowed us to focus on statistical thinking rather than spending more time on real analysis type issues than necessary, while also making sure that what we were doing was correct (unlike in Stat 111). Definitely really really enjoyed it and felt as though it was great at helping me learn.<br/>	So yes, in conclusion, a course that is both amazing and very very bizarrely run. You will learn a lot from it, but I am not sure how much of the learning (and especially the assessment of how much you have learned) actually comes from the outcome&ndash;based aspects of the course. In any case, I will let you make your own judgement on whether you want to do this, and whatever your decision is, I wish you the best of luck.</td>

But given that the exam is 16 hours you don&#x27;t really need to study before the exam, like you can just look through the lecture notes during the exam and not needing to worry about the exam before the exam is a big W in my opinion. Other than that, the grading on the exam is also very chill. Because they exam is so hard a lot of partial credit is given out, which I think is kind of unfair to those that actually solved the problem. However, the homeworks are quite annoying and the TFs will actually take off random points off and refuse to given them back even though the solution is completely correct. So the general advice is just do well on the exams so you don&#x27;t have to worry about homeworks.</td>
