The materials are good and the assignments are reasonable and fair. In some of the workshops and in guest lectures you get to learn about the interesting research directions in neuroscience. I wouldn&#x27;t quite call it a GEM because you still need to put work in to do well in the course, but it is moderate and probably equivalent to EC10. Overall really good course.</td>

It&#x27;s really good at introducing you to general neuro topics and does it at a pretty good pace. My one ick is that there&#x27;s video notes you have to do on top of the in&ndash;person lectures, but the goal is to get you familiar with the topics before lecture so that you can engage in interactive experiences there.  I will also say PLEASE GO TO OFFICE HOURS. You absolutely need to go to them in order to do well on the PSets. Also, there&#x27;s some pretty good extra credit opportunities on PSets and participation so I recommend doing those. In the end, I would recommend this course. Have fun.</td>

You definitely get out what you put in when it comes to the course material, as it is very easy to skim by doing the bare minimum, but if you actually want to engage in the subject matter and learn more about the field of neuroscience, there are plenty of resources within this course to help you do so. The teaching staff want to help you and talk about these topics with you and I think this is definitely one of this course&#x27;s strengths. The bulk of my learning occurred in section and is definitely dependent on your section leader and positively shaped my entire learning experience. <br/>If you have taken a psychology class before, the end of the course and some of the concepts throughout will be very familiar but you will have to think about and engage with them in a very different way which may be confusing at first, but will make your end of semester much easier. <br/>While this was personally not my favorite class and often felt very redundant at points, it is a good introductory class to neuroscience and thinking about the mind from a biological perspective.</td>

Nothing against this class, but neuro is just not what I expected. Also if you are a freshman wondering if you can&#x2F;should take this, you can, and there is really nothing you lose from taking it now. I am really glad I took it now so that I knew whether I liked neuro or not. Most people in the class will be sophomores though. <br/><br/>The first half of this class is very specific to what goes on in individual neurons so it was hard to see the big picture. The second half gets a good bit more fun, though, and we learn about more real life applications, but it really just became a memorization game. Overall, you should take it if you have any interest in the brain. This class won&#x27;t take up too much time, but the format is rather unfortunate. If you&#x27;ve taken LS1a, it&#x27;s similar in that all the material you learn is essentially outside of lecture. Most people didn&#x27;t enjoy this, and it also made in person lecture feel like a joke because it was just a worse version of the required videos. The key to this class is the &quot;lecture notes&quot; they publish every week with 2 pages summarizing that weeks material. All exam questions are based on the weekly objectives at the end of these notes, so it&#x27;s really all you need. Problem sets are easy and only take about 2 hours, and you can go to office hours to make sure you get a 100 on all of them. Section is the best part of the class, and all of the TF&#x27;s are amazing. Exams are not too bad, and people to abnormally well. I got a 92 on the midterm and was below the median. That being said, there is no curve, so around half the people in the class get an A. Take this class if you are interested, and don&#x27;t stress too much about it. You&#x27;ll be fine, good luck!</td>

Katie is a great professor and is super excited about the topic and happy to help anyone of any science background!!! The teaching staff in general is just AMAZING. In general, problem sets don&#x27;t take that much time and they&#x27;re super reasonable and don&#x27;t ask things you wouldn&#x27;t know how to do based off of stuff learned from the weekly material. Additionally, exams are reasonable and based on what we learn throughout the semester. I didn&#x27;t feel like any curveballs were thrown at us throughout the semester. Overall, HIGHLY RECOMMEND.</td>

It is a great class to pair with orgo because the work load is manageable. However, I feel like chem 17 honestly sucked the fun out of neuro 80 for me. I would&#x27;ve enjoyed the class a WHOLE lot more if I had more time to devote to watching the lectures and paying full attention during workshop. Just know if you take orgo at the same time, it will be doable but will feel less exciting.<br/><br/>The first half of the class has a big focus on signaling between neurons and chemistry (ion flow, action potentials, synaptic potentials). It is definitely the more challenging half. The second half is more abstract topics (vision, neurodegeneration, memory) where you apply the knowledge you learned in the first half. <br/><br/>The weekly workload includes: lecture videos (due Tues and Thurs), weekly quiz (due Fri), problem set (due Mon morning). In addition, there are two online tests, a midterm, and a final. Although it seems like a lot, I appreciate that every assignment has a purpose. The tests are a good check&ndash;in to study a good chunk of material before moving on, which helps a lot when it comes to studying for the midterm or final. <br/><br/>Some will say the class is an easy A, and that&#x27;s simply due to the amount of extra credit opportunities you get from attendance and making cheat sheets for the tests. However, the exams are not an easy A! You do need to study. Again, being in chem 17 did not help, but do not underestimate the midterm and final. They are worth a lot of your grade and they can be tricky sometimes. <br/><br/>Even the two online tests can be tricky even though they&#x27;re open note, so make sure you study for those too before taking them. They are timed (just 30 minutes) so there isn&#x27;t enough time to flip through notes and psets. However, you are allowed to make a cheat sheet and submit it for 0.5 point extra credit&ndash;&ndash; do it!! It helps you study and gain back points. Don&#x27;t underestimate the tests. <br/><br/>Overall, it&#x27;s really interesting! It can spark a lot of different interests and potential areas of research you want to go into. If you&#x27;re in chem 17, don&#x27;t let this class fall behind. <br/><br/>Tips:<br/>&ndash; Go to all the workshops if you can! Staying in your dorm can&#x27;t beat getting 104% on participation. <br/>&ndash; Stay as engaged as you can&ndash;&ndash; if you weren&#x27;t locked in while watching the lecture videos, pay attention during workshop. <br/>&ndash; Go to the exam review sessions. <br/>&ndash; Get to know your TF! The Neuro 80 TF&#x27;s are all really cool and do cool research (shoutout Josie!!!)<br/>&ndash; Go to at least one office hour, and then go to the problem solving session with the CAs if you need more help on the pset.</td>

I recommend this class to everyone; you will develop a much better appreciation of how complicated you are as a sapient being! Really try to take this class at some point during your four years here.<br/><br/>In terms of workload, you will require a significant amount of diligence outside of class. Before each class, you have to watch 2&ndash;4 video lectures that are usually altogether an hour to an hour and half in total length. Individual videos range from about 5 minutes to 45 minutes, but the total length of all the videos typically stays consistent. You are expected to know pretty much all of it on the tests and exams, so I recommend taking detailed notes. I would not just look at the slides or read the notes posted on Canvas; I found that I learned the content much better if I watched all the lecture videos. I would also try not to fall behind as it can be difficult to catch up since you will have new videos to watch. If you keep yourself honest and actually watch and take detailed notes on all the lectures, you will have a much better time preparing for the exams.<br/><br/>The section quality depends on the TF. If you go to a certain TF the first week and do not think they are a good teacher, consider talking to your friends about their experiences and, if possible, switching to a section of someone who had a positive experience. Personally, I very much liked my TF (Alex Chen). He was an excellent explainer and fostered a chill, friendly environment in the classroom.<br/><br/>Overall, this course is great!

The in person exams are completely fair and the online tests should be treated like real exams (as in, you should actually study if you wanna see good results because they can be tricky). Sunday night problem solving sessions were my best friend. Finish the pset on your own and go there to get your answered confirmed&#x2F;reviewed with peers and CAs and you’ll be good to go. Make sure you’re keeping track of learning objective answers after each lecture because that’s all you’re gonna be tested on, I promise. The best way to learn isn’t by rewatching lectures, it’s by reading through the lecture notes, understanding topics conceptually, redoing the psets, and going through everything to answer the objectives and memorizing their answers.</td>
