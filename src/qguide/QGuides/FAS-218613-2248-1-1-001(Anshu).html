One professor is amazing (Salil) and the other struggled to lecture effectively (Anurag), although both are very kind. Problem sets are tough on your own, but collaborating makes them much more manageable. Grading is on a sort of check&ndash;plus&#x2F;check&#x2F;check&ndash;minus system which is nice.

The teaching staff is so amazing and supportive, it&#x27;s insane. <br/><br/>Section is optional, but offered so many times a week that you should just go because it reinforces the content in a low&ndash;stress way. The PSETS are really fun and super super relevant to the class, but they may take some time, so start them early! Every lecture has a huge detailed lecture notes attached to it, making it super possible to revisit a topic and refer to during the PSETS. <br/><br/>Salil and Anurag are the nicest professors ever! If Maxwell is TF&ndash;ing, you are set.  <br/><br/>Take this class, you won&#x27;t regret it.</td>

Lecturers are very passionate and enthusiastic, and extremely nice to talk to as well. The problem sets are all reasonable, especially with the help of office hours at times. The TFs are incredibly helpful, definitely make sure to use all of the resources, as it will make your life much easier when taking this course.</td>

Lectures are sometimes quite difficult to follow because they get so technical, and the lecture notes are also quite hard to read. Definitely go to OH for the pets, and form a study group as soon as you can.</td>

Overall great course content, very interesting material and a great introduction to algorithms and limitations (as the course name suggests). Maxwell is super helpful and a great TF. Salil and Anshu are very good lecturers as well. Exams were fair and fairly graded. You get 8 late days which is also very helpful. You have to be familiar with a lot of math&#x2F;proof notation (at the level of Math22a for example), so take CS 20 if you have no prior experience.</td>

It&#x27;s not particularly engaging or interesting, but it has to be done for the requirement + to learn Leet code (if that&#x27;s ur jam).<br/><br/>Doesn&#x27;t take very much time. Lecture is not worth attending or watching IMO. Read the notes, wikipedia, ask chat to explain things to you.<br/><br/>If you really focus, you can get all the work done in 2&ndash;5 hours&#x2F;week.</td>

The course I feel gives you a very academic understanding of algorithms and their limitations, but I don&#x27;t feel I walked away with very transferrable skills with the exception of how to make and think in terms of solid proofs. It is very good in that sense.</td>

The material was very interesting and I learned more about algorithms. I really enjoyed listening to the professors lecture and I think that the teaching fellows also did a great job of explaining the material. Going to office hours was very helpful when trying to understand material and working on problem sets. Being able to revise the problem set answers was very helpful and I hope that the professors keep that up.</td>

I took this and CS61 simultaneously and 1200 was not that bad comparatively. This year, the class was redesigned to make psets a little shorter (~8 hours a week), and I&#x27;d say it would vary week to week, but the psets would typically take 6&ndash;10 hours, with maybe 1 or 2 outliers taking more than 10 hours. That being said, office hours is super helpful and makes completing the psets so much easier. Lecture is useful, especially Salil&#x27;s lectures, but if you miss a class the detailed notes are mostly enough to ensure you understand what is going on. Section is optional which is fantastic &ndash; I never went &ndash; but I still was able to understand material and do well on psets without going.</td>

The switch was just disorienting<br/><br/>Semester schedule: Sophomore Fall &ndash; {STAT 110, COMPSCI 1090A, GenEd, COMPSCI 1200}<br/><br/><br/>Hours Breakdown:<br/>Problem set 0 &ndash; 0 hours (I didn’t do it because I started the course late)<br/>Problem set 1 &ndash; 7 hours (Got  0.0 out 3.1) because I just didn’t know what was going on &ndash; got revised after a revision video though<br/>Problem set 2 &ndash;  6 hours<br/>Problem set 3 &ndash; 7 hours <br/>Problem set 4 &ndash; 6 hours<br/>Problem set 5 &ndash; 10 hours (pretty tough pset for me) <br/>Problem set 6 &ndash; 8 hours (just a long pset)<br/>Problem set 7 &ndash; 7 hours<br/>Problem set 8 &ndash; 9 hours (probably the pset I locked in on the most) &ndash; also very useful for the final<br/>—Thanksgiving Break—<br/>Problem set 9 &ndash; 8 hours (at this point you will probably be jaded by the semester, especially if you are a sophomore, but if you can lock in on this pset, this will set you up well for the final)<br/><br/><br/>Grade Performance:<br/>Did around the median for the first midterm. It’s pretty easy to get an R, (3.0 points), on each problem set. (Grades for the final just dropped as I was writing this review). I did well on the final. Still on course for an A or A&ndash; but I don’t know what this depends on. <br/><br/>Best part about the course:<br/>Maxwell Zen. <br/><br/>Worst part about the course:<br/>It felt a bit wish washy at some point. Too subjective. You don’t really know what you need to do to get an R+(highest grade on a pset), and you’d spend hours on a pset and get the same grade on a pset as someone who spent 3 hours lol. Which I’m not really complaining about, it’s just that doing that and basing grades on a curve, makes it such that exams are high stakes situations, when they shouldn’t necessarily be this. After 5 iterations of the course, I’m hoping more data is being collected on what works for the course and what doesn’t. Just have fixed cutoffs for the grades.<br/><br/>Instruction: I was super lost for some of the lectures, and I like Anshu but his delivery was sometimes a little disoriented. <br/><br/>TLDR: Kinda an interesting course. Ace the exams because they determine your grade more than the psets do. Take it because it fulfills the formal reasoning requirements for CS. Be a bit rigorous with it, especially if you are getting ready to take CS 1240. I didn’t really have fun in this course, but the material was interesting.</td>

			<td class="TabularBody_LeftColumn" headers="comment-2_2cab8c32-7416-4cb2-83a2-dfbfbcbb8efd">Overall I think this is a very nice course! I will note I came in with what I would call substantial mathematical maturity (I took math25). I think the course would be harder to approach for someone that&#x27;s just learning proof structures like induction, contraposition, contradiction. For the rising sophomores looking to take the class, I would suggest going over some of these basic proof techniques that you might have learned in your cs20&#x2F;similar background. Having some grasp of these ideas will help you tremendously.<br/><br/>I don&#x27;t think the proofs in the course require a great deal of cleverness or insight, especially not on exams. I would study the course content and I think if you know the course content you will be fine. The exams I believe were fair and of moderate difficulty level. As long as you study and prepare I think you will be fine. <br/><br/>I would suggest doing the psets on your own at first and really thinking through the problems, but having a good pset group can be really helpful too. And I met some really cool people through cs120 that I really bonded with! I think the course overall does a great job of attempting to build community, though I sort of stumbled on my new friends by happenstance. Either way, I&#x27;m grateful to have found cool people to pset with and to have made new friends. Be open to meeting some cool new people through cs120! It&#x27;ll make your life in the course a lot more fun. Don&#x27;t be a stereotypical antisocial CS kid &ndash; even if you can do the psets on your own without any help, I suggest interacting with other people. Talking through and explaining ideas in the class are good ways to build in some early prep that pays off at exam time.<br/><br/>The SREs are really not that painful, and some of them are quite enjoyable. Just set your alarm and make sure you get on that SEC shuttle. Having the one drop is pretty nice and gives a little bit of leeway.<br/><br/>I think Salil is a really good lecturer. He explains things clearly and is really likable and personable. And he&#x27;s even active on Ed sometimes! (Which tends to be a rarity among really senior professors. I appreciate him being down to earth like that.)<br/><br/>I think Anurag is an amazing person and professor too, though I think by virtue of being so prolific in CS as a researcher he might have forgotten what it&#x27;s like to learn these concepts for the first time and I wish he might emphasize different aspects of the content when lecturing. He had a tendency to linger for quite some time on really simple stuff that students get quickly and gloss over concepts that he seemed to regard as trivial but were actually quite subtle details worth spending some time on.<br/><br/>One of our head TFs in the course Maxwell was truly phenomenal! I really appreciated his review sessions for the midterm and final, and I think they were very much worth going to, at least until they diverged into kind of trivial questions by students that were just really confused (this is not at all the fault of Maxwell). I do hope that future iterations of the course will be lucky enough to have a TF willing to take on conducting quality review sessions. If this is the case, I absolutely recommend making use of that resource.<br/><br/>Honestly I don&#x27;t think I ever went to section. It&#x27;s there if you want it, and I heard from friends that a lot of them were really excellent. Section just isn&#x27;t how I prefer to learn. Reading the lecture notes is great review though, as they are really high quality. <br/><br/>Office hours were good, though oftentimes very crowded. Sometimes the TFs seemed to not quite grasp the pset entirely or lead students astray, but generally I think they were as good as can reasonably be expected and I really appreciate all their effort. Honestly I don&#x27;t think the course is so terribly difficult that you need to be at office hours trying to farm everything, and you really do yourself a disservice come exam time if you don&#x27;t try to independently think through the problems. Think for yourself (you learn more that way), and get yourself a nice group of friends (see above) in the class. Again, meet new people!<br/><br/>Grading wise: I don&#x27;t think it was that hard to earn R+&#x27;s on the psets, but you do need to be mathematically rigorous to an extent (see above again). For the participation, really just write in depth responses and you can score some R+&#x27;s. Honestly I am a little concerned about how they will draw final grades especially between A and A&ndash; grades. I would be careful and try to do your best especially on the exams. I think most students, especially with all the revisions allowed, get really high pset scores, so the exams seem to be the primary way they differentiate amongst students which is a bit stressful. I do wish they were more transparent about the +&#x2F;&ndash; modifiers and what exam performance correlates and more detail about the grade distribution.<br/><br/>Overall though a great course. I think you get a lot about elegance in computer science theory and learn to appreciate the more theoretical side of algorithms. Some of the content can be really beautiful. Honestly all things considered I am glad I took the class. Thanks to the professors and TFs for a great semester!</td>

My advice is to take CS 120 before CS124 though and just knock out the algos requirements sooner rather than later.

Attendance is only mandatory for SREs though which is great. SREs are kind of tricky though because if your partner didn&#x27;t read up ahead, you have to catch up but it&#x27;s a great way to learn. I&#x27;d say the homework is challenging but they offer enough opportunity to make them up so it&#x27;s okay. Exams are within the acceptable range of difficulty. Not too hard and not too easy.

I found it more useful to just read the lecture notes &#x2F; solutions and learn myself lol. Maybe the pacing got better by the end of the course but I wouldn&#x27;t know.

			<td class="TabularBody_LeftColumn" headers="comment-2_2cab8c32-7416-4cb2-83a2-dfbfbcbb8efd">You’re graded on a R+&#x2F;R&#x2F;R&ndash;&#x2F;L&#x2F;N system. It always seems a bit unclear on how you achieve any one of these grades. On some days you’ll get your PSET back and think “damn, I should’ve probably gotten lower than that,” and on other days you’ll be like “I definitely deserved higher than that.” What constitutes an R&#x2F;R&ndash;&#x2F;L seems to be, at least from the perspective of a student, more of a vibe thing more than anything (although I’m not sure if the TFs have a strict grading system to follow or not). And while they have guidelines on what constitutes an A (or at least what guarantees an A) on the syllabus, you’ll still have your grade sort of up in the air if you happen to miss any one of those categories.<br/><br/>You’re given 8 late days. Wednesdays were when homework was due but Wednesdays also happened to be very busy for me, so I took up all 8 late days. This is very gracious of them to offer, and I appreciate this a lot.<br/><br/>I never went to section nor did I attend lecture, it was entirely optional (there are certain days in which you need to show up and memorize a proof beforehand and be able to explain it to someone, and some days where you’re the one being explained to). But I think if I was more locked in I would’ve gone. Maxwell Zen is a great TF, and watching just two review videos (that totaled up to 7 hours of content) on the day before the final exam probably saved my final exam score. I had felt like I had learned nothing by the end of the course, but Maxwell’s content review showed me how much I had really learned and made up for a lot of lost section and lecture .<br/><br/>I believe the class could be a bit more explicit in when a reduction proof needs a correction or runtime proofs alongside them. Some of the PSETs were quite tedious for no apparent reason, especially for problems where you resolve SAT clauses. <br/><br/>Regardless, I think this class is very nicely structured. You get into a nice pattern, grading seems to be quite lenient and there are many chances to correct your mistakes for extra credit on PSETs (bumps you up from L to R&ndash;, for example), late days are quite lenient. You’ll want to form a nice PSET group or attend office hours. ChatGPT can help here, but you’ll need to keep in mind that CS1200 has certain definitions that ChatGPT won’t pick up. For example, ChatGPT may recognize that NP_{search} problems must be verifiable in polynomial time, but CS1200 needs you to recognize that the outputs of said problems must be of polynomial length. But, given enough context, you can maybe slide by with it. But ultimately you’ll learn less and would have spent more time than if you just went to multiple office hours (unfortunately some of these are very crowded). Good source of insight in guiding hints, though. Take this class, you’ll be okay, just don’t forget to stay on top of things.</td>

In that case, I would recommend it over CS1210. While the course itself is newer than 1210, a fact that is apparent at times due to a lack of management and structure, it does a better job at concretely building foundations of Computer Science. Most people take 1200 having taken CS50 and CS20 their freshman year. In that case, I would give a word of caution: this course is not easy, in fact it might be the hardest CS course you might encounter so far. But I believe it is this challenging nature of this course that makes it equally rewarding as it does make you a better proof writer and problem solver. Another word of caution: this is not a typical programming course, in a way that it is almost more mathematical than code&ndash;heavy. So even if you do have experience with coding, there will be times when you might feel completely lost writing a 2&ndash;page long proof. But regardless, as long as you start the psets early and find a study group, you will have a great time in this course :))</td>

Some tips that I can recommend: 1. PLEASE go to office hours. Unless you thoroughly understand the topic of the current problem set, it can be very difficult to even understand how to start most problems, let alone completely finish them. Office hours are incredibly helpful at providing a little extra info that is beyond helpful to have to be able to do the problems given. 2. Follow the detailed guided notes and PAY ATTENTION IN LECTURE. I did not follow this advice. Out of the 25 lectures that were given, I probably attended at most 5 of them. I spent each week just reviewing the detailed lecture notes enough to make it through the problem set while working with others. When it got to reading period, I decided I should probably go back and watch all the lectures. It was unbelievable the difference it made in my understanding of each topic discussed in the course. 3. Knowing how an algorithm works line by line is not important at all imo. On the other hand, knowing how the algorithm works by concept, knowing its time complexity and its purpose, those are infinitely more helpful. Knowing this about each algorithm that is talked about in class and in the problem sets helps build up an understanding that allows you to further comprehend topics, algorithms, and problems in the course.<br/>Overall, I think the course is a great start to theoretical CS. I certainly do not enjoy theoretical CS, but hey, now I know how to do it.</td>
