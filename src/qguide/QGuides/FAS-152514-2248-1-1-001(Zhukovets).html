A lot of people say that it is not a class for those with no experience, but if you are willing to put in the time and effort, this class is completely manageable. I had limited previous CS knowledge (never took APs or did any competitions in high school) but did fine with just around 6 hours per week. Moreover, this wasn’t my heaviest class this semester either. The duck is super helpful, and after looking through the notes most of the problem set is quite simple.</td>

I think the overwhelming amount of support you get from taking CS50 is what makes it such a good introductory class. You really are learning a lot about how computers work in general and getting massive exposure to a bunch of different languages and their functions. Some PSETs are harder than others and you can just use the duck to get all the answers, but then are you really learning anything about coding? I think the breadth of the class gives you a good feel about computer science and if you really want to get into it. You learn about how coding can take waaay longer than you imagined but also how to reiterate and learn. PSETs can be stressful if you leave them for last minute sunday night, but if you work on them during the week they are manageable. Coming from a sophomore, I would def recommend taking this class freshman year because of the amount of freshies also taking it and the amount of effort the teaching staff does to make you meet people. Genuinely a quintessential freshman class and I wish I had taken it a bit earlier in my academic journey. It&#x27;s a class that has a lot of work, but you learn a lot as well and get mega exposure to computer science and the chance to bump into a lot of freshman friends while working through the psets and going to class.</td>

Even APCS is enough to be able to self&ndash;teach &#x2F; skip this course, and CS61 &#x2F; CS120&#x2F;121 are other great CS courses you can try out if you are more advanced. The Friday lunches with companies are pretty good though.</td>

This class should help you figure out whether CS is for you or not. The PSETS can get very long, and some of the problems are challenging, but there is plenty of resources and help available. An essential class for anyone who is even remotely thinking about doing CS, although students who just want to learn programming might want to consider other courses first.</td>

Things to keep in mind should you decide to take this course:<br/><br/>&ndash;START PSETS EARLY. This applies especially after like the first 2&ndash;3 psets. you&#x27;re going to want to start the pset on Wednesday&#x2F;Thursday at least.<br/>&ndash;Go to office hours. There are office hours almost all hours during the day, so take advantage of that.<br/>&ndash;I know its tempting, but you should stay&#x2F;actually attend lecture. It makes a difference in how much of the material you grasp.<br/>&ndash;have fun! Especially on the final project! You have plenty of time to do it, so assuming you actually start early, you&#x27;ll be really fulfilled and have so much fun.</td>

CS 50 does a great job of introducing concepts that are traditionally hard to understand. The course flow is great, and the material gives you a strong foundation to build on after the course is over. I am happy I took it over a pure programming course, as I now have an excellent understanding of how higher languages like Python operate due to the course starting with C.</td>

I took AP CSA in high school, and I still found this class somewhat demanding. If you have no coding experience, this class is still very doable, but be ready to set a little bit more time aside for the work. There is a great first year community in CS50, and it&#x27;s just a great experience in general. The psets toward the end of class were fairly challenging, but those were the ones that really made me interested in CS. It&#x27;s a great class if you keep up. Take it!</td>

You go over so many languages and learn about the functions of so many things that it&#x27;s a great starting point to see if you are interested in computer science and what you might want to use it for in the future. The tfs are great and if you need help with psets, office hours will do wonders. There are a million resources available to you to get help. David is such an entertaining lecturer (he talks pretty fast though), but the lectures are recorded which are good to look back on. It is a decent amount of work but it&#x27;s just one pset a week so if you plan it out you&#x27;ll be in a good spot.</td>

If you don&#x27;t go to&#x2F;watch the lecture at least read the lecture notes, they are helpful. This class does not teach you how to code per se but more to understand what is happening when you see code or engage with it. It does get into the weeds at times which is unfortunate and there is often a big jump from the abstractness of lecture to the PSET.

			<td class="TabularBody_LeftColumn" headers="comment-2_91d29d9c-8987-4a4b-a092-970b43a19dcb">First off: I had no experience in CS before taking this class. I am not a CS major, and probably will not be. I took CS50 as an elective, just because I wanted to take one computer science class during my time in college and thought CS50 was the one to do. I also took this class sat&#x2F;unsat. If you are not any of these, feel free to ignore my comments, however:<br/><br/>I really really enjoyed this class. Yes, the Checks for Understanding can get a little annoying, the Psets can get stressful if you only have time to start them on the weekends and can&#x27;t go to the Widener Library office hours on Sundays (cough cough &ndash; me), and the course moves very quickly through different coding languages, but, looking back, this class has been extremely rewarding. The course assistants and professors will tell you this, and really take it to heart: the goal of this course is not to teach you how to code, but rather to teach you how to understand programming and teach yourself further. You do learn C, Python, SQL, HTML, JavaScript and a couple others, but ultimately oriented towards understanding what programming languages can do and how they function. <br/><br/>The lectures are great and Prof. Malan is a very engaging speaker. The lectures may be long, but to get through them I recommend sitting close to the front of the room to properly see and hear everything Prof. Malan does (it really goes a long way). If you absolutely have to take notes, you can, though it can be easy to get distracted and thus I recommend either working on GitHub with Prof. Malan (to internalize all the topics he discusses) or taking no notes at all and just listening (the lecture notes are EXTREMELY helpful). I still recommend going to at least the first half of lecture, since waiting to watch the video can make you very behind.<br/><br/>Don&#x27;t feel at all ashamed about section placement, and if you have no experience, feel free to say you are &quot;least&quot; comfortable. I put &quot;less,&quot; and while I had a good TF, sometimes even &quot;less&quot; comfortable TFs can be tough on design. People might tell you (including in the Q&ndash;Reports) that it is a lie that most people who take the class have no previous CS experience. There are a lot of people in this class who do and can (frankly and no offense!) be quite vocal about it, especially since there is the infamous problem of people with lots of experience going into easier sections to get better grades.<br/><br/>Also, go to the CS50 lunches! It is a good break from Annenberg food and you get to meet a lot of people there! Sometimes they bring in recruiters (which I personally was not the biggest fan of, but it is in keeping with the &quot;celebrity&quot; status of the class).<br/><br/>What else to say &ndash; go to office hours, start Psets earlier (unlike me), don&#x27;t be afraid or embarrassed to use the duck&ndash;debugger, pick a final project you&#x27;d have fun doing (I made a guessing game which I still play every day), and ultimately realize that there might be some tedium to CS (and debugging), but this class is ultimately really rewarding and has helped me both be comfortable looking at any code and think in new ways of how to solve any non&ndash;CS&ndash;related problem.</td>

All other classes here feel like they are taught in the most effective way possible, but that is not the case with this class. Lectures are fast and uninformative. As a beginner programmer, you will struggle to keep up with and understand the lectures. Since lecture is 3 hours long, if you don&#x27;t understand the beginning, the end is inaccessible. Section was where all of the learning happened, but since those are also 3 hours long, the same problem somewhat applies. It would be far more effective to break up the time in class.<br/><br/>If you take the class, you can learn a lot, but you need to put a lot of extra time into it on top of the 6&ndash;7 hours of class time per week. The psets are long and challenging, so start early.</td>

You won’t go into too much depth on any one language, but it gives you a pretty solid foundation to continue learning if you want. This class has people with very different experience levels and backgrounds, but I think it does a pretty good job of catering to everyone.<br/>You can find all this information on the website, but basically you get assigned a section according to how you rate yourself from least comfortable to most comfortable with the material. Each week there are usually harder and easier versions of the pset, and you can choose which to do. If you do both you can keep the higher score. The default grading system for CS50 is Sat&#x2F;unsat, but if you want to count it for a concentration that requires a letter grade you can switch to letter graded.<br/>The difficulty level and time commitment will depend a lot on what your experience with different programing languages is, if your taking the class graded, and if you go to office hours. For example, I only had experience with Java, so I was pretty relaxed during the first half of the course because c and python were pretty similar to Java. The website programming was a struggle for me though and I had to put in a lot more time to understand it.<br/>If you have a lot of CS experience you might want to think about going straight to CS61, but you can still learn a lot even if you have programming experience. For example, I did AP compsci and one class on data structures in high school, and for me it was definitely the right move to take CS50. You can just choose a more comfortable section and do the hard and easy programs for each pset.<br/>Starting early on the psets if you think you might run into problems is really helpful, because you can save yourself a lot of time and frustration by going to office hours! (There are sunday office hours in widener and smaller ones you can schedule with a TF) The CS50 debugger is honestly pretty confusing for me compared to something like eclipse, so for debugging you kind of just have to ask the ai duck or a TF.<br/>I thought this class was a fun experience, and it was a good way to meet people.

The class is extremely well organized, with lots of resources and help offered outside of class. I really enjoyed the problem sets and thought that they allowed me to synthesize the lecture material each week. <br/><br/>My one criticism of the course is how it is graded. The course grades are normalized across sections (i.e. if all the students in one section have better grades than another section, these are counterbalanced at the end of the semester). This makes it so that students do not know how well they are doing throughout the semester: even if they appear to be doing well on psets and weekly quizzes, if they are doing slightly worse than the rest of their section mates, than they may end up with a  bad grade. I think that this creates a competitive atmosphere within sections and makes it needlessly stressful for students. <br/><br/>Otherwise, I loved this class and would recommend, especially if you are taking it pass fail.</td>

That being said, there is so much support and the T.F.s are all wonderful. There are also no exams, and the final is a project you get two weeks on (and is great for building a portfolio) . If you put in the work you truly learn so much and will do well in the class, but it is not easy. 3 hour lectures are a bit rough as its easy to not pay attention but sectioning is awesome. Start psets early so you can go to office hours and not be stressed over the weekend, as they tend to take longer than you would think. Overall would recommend!</td>

If you are in a similar situation, here is some of my advice on this route:<br/><br/>PSets took about 3&ndash;4 hours a week for me, and I usually ended up doing them on Sunday night. I know someone else with similar courses who was able to knock them out earlier in the week.  I&#x27;m quite perfectionistic so this is definitely a conservatively large amount of time.<br/><br/>I learned about C pointers but didn&#x27;t really learn much new information. Most of the benefit for me was just in getting back into the flow of actual programming.<br/><br/>Balance your work on the final project!

I will say there are some things you might need to consider:<br/><br/>1. The time blocks for CS50 are pretty hefty. Nearly a 3&ndash;hour straight lecture and then a nearly 3&ndash;hour straight section. PSets range in difficulty and time commitment. The last one in particular (Finance) can be a nightmare without the right tips and tricks to get by. We were told to prepare to spend 10 hours and to save our 72 hour PSet extension allowance for that one. TLDR: This can be a big time commitment.<br/><br/>2. Use the notes. They are a great resource to have if you did not understand lecture and do not want to go back through the recording. <br/><br/>PERSONAL HACK!!!!! The course is fine with people who have enrolled in edX prior to starting CS50 as well. I was already curious about the class so I enrolled in CS50 edX over the summer to sample it (I was scared to start) and while I only watched Lecture 0, I ended up gaining access to the notes. It doesn&#x27;t do anything to make you &quot;cheat&quot; in any way &ndash; hence why they do not have a rule against edX takers. My biggest hack for those that have no idea what&#x27;s happening in CS is that I would copy and paste the code from the edX notes (which are usually very similar if not identical to what Professor Malan will go through) so that I can make annotations using comments in cs50.dev (Visual Studio Code for CS50) and then screenshot them for notes. It makes sure I don&#x27;t have to transcribe AND make notes about the code and I found that when I come to section, I wouldn&#x27;t need to revise them because the annotations during lecture were sufficient in helping me just &quot;get it&quot;.<br/><br/>3. The course has features that are built&ndash;in so that you have an abundance of resources to get you to succeed. Office hours, CS50.ai, Ed, etc... Do not hesitate to use them. I feel like it&#x27;s clear that the course wants everyone to succeed. You can feel very supported if you look for the support.<br/><br/>Have fun! Be strategic (see above). I hope if you take it, you&#x27;ll enjoy it just as much as I did.</td>

As someone who had a good amount of knowledge coming into the course, I felt unprepared at times and struggled with some of the psets. The course content moves incredibly fast in lecture, making it hard to stay on track. Furthermore, the most minute details from the lecture are asked about in checks for understanding, which you can easily lose points over. This class is supposedly iconic. However, I don&#x27;t think it is taught very well. A lot of CS is about repeated problem&ndash;solving, and doing one pset a week doesn&#x27;t help to reinforce concepts, especially some of the more difficult ones. Additionally, because the lectures are so long, it is hard to stay engaged in the course material, which can cause you to easily fall behind. The grading process is also atrocious. Points are sometimes taken off for arbitrary reasons. For example, you could go to the office hours of another TF than your own and they might tell you to implement something a certain way, and your TF will take off points for this. Upon addressing this issue with the course heads, they do nothing about it. The course can feel incredibly isolating at time due to the number of people who are taking it. Taking the course honestly felt like being a part of a corporation program, due to how it seems like a well&ndash;oiled machine.  I will admit that the iconic events like hackathon and cs50 fair are very fun, however, I don&#x27;t think it makes taking this course worth it. Coming in, I felt like I had to take this course because it was iconic and because I am considering a cs major. I am less sure now of my major because of this class. If you&#x27;re willing to feel like you are always behind in this class, spend every Sunday in office hours struggling over the PSETs, and feel frustrated over the grading process then this class can be worth it for you because at the end of the day, you do learn a lot of programming languages.</td>

Whether it&#x27;s for your concentration or the quant requirement, CS50 teaches you an understanding of code that will be applicable for the foreseeable future, even when AI can write any code instantaneously. You don&#x27;t have to have any CS experience, although that will make the first month or so more difficult than it would be otherwise. To enjoy the class 1) put yourself in a section skill level lower than you expect (typically &quot;less&ndash;comfortable&quot;) 2) use the CS50 AI on problem sets whenever you are confused or stuck or anytime in general 3) go to office hours on weeks 7&ndash;9 where the problem sets get tough. If you do this, your problem&ndash;set grades will be better and you will spend less time on the course.</td>

I recommend thinking hard and examining the rigor of your other classes before deciding to take this class.

Make sure to really pay attention during lectures (it can be easy to zone out because they are quite long), it really helps. Also, there is tons of help available if you need it, so just ask for help if you&#x27;re stuck. 9&#x2F;10 times one of the instructors can clear up any questions&#x2F; issues you have.<br/>I would say that this course is not quite as introductory as they advertise, but it&#x27;s definitely still doable even if you are completely new to cs. Tons of people are in the same boat, so don&#x27;t feel bad if you&#x27;re lost!</td>
