As someone with little coding experience, this was super difficult. I wish the class had been less focused on coding, because I likely would&#x27;ve gained a greater understanding of the concepts behind statistical analysis. Instead, I spent lots of time frustrated at my code. The TFs were super helpful though, I highly recommend office hours. There were also many opportunities to improve your grade, which I really appreciated.</td>

The material is not that difficult, but the coding part of the assignments&#x2F;exams is the most difficult. The structure of the class can be a bit confusing, since there are no lectures but videos covering the material that you&#x27;re expected to watch before going to class. Classes are labs and you only have to attend once a week. It&#x27;s easy to fall behind due to the structure of the class, but it is important to stay up to date with the material because each week builds on top of each other. PSETS are once a week and they probably take 3&ndash;5 hours to complete.</td>

I do not know anyone in this class who enjoyed it or thought it was easy.  This was unnecessarily difficult because the content is not bad, but it is very poorly taught. <br/><br/>A lot of the TFs were really really great.  But other TFs did not make an effort and some SOME TFs WOULD NOT SHOW UP TO OFFICE HOURS (with no warning), and that leaves you hanging because you need them for PSETs<br/><br/>THIS IS NOT A STATS CLASS, it is an introductory R coding class.

Everything up to the midterm was fine and fair, but holy oh. my. goodness. Everything after? Yeah. Straight up insane. That&#x27;s when you really need to lock in, and it&#x27;s super hard. The annoying part? The final doesn&#x27;t even test you on half the stuff you learned after the midterm, and so you end up studying hours of content that is insanely difficult conceptually, forgetting about the seemingly basic stuff, and then kind of get screwed over during the final. Long story short, just stay on top of your work. This class is hard and annoying.</td>

Only take this class if there are proper Professors teaching.

PSets took me many hours a week and the flipped classroom setup was really inefficient, where we were supposed learn on our own from a video and review (?) in class. I did not learn anything in class, so basically had to teach myself every week which took a while. I actually enjoyed what we were learning, and it was cool to learn how to code in R. I had no experience coding or doing statistics but the CA&#x27;s were amazing and helped me succeed. I heard they are changing the entire structure next semester so take this with a grain of salt&ndash; not a terrible class but given the interesting and somewhat intuitive material it should be taught better, and should not have felt like so much of a challenge.</td>

Yes, it is hard, I will not sugar coat that part. There is a lot of content, the psets are very long, there are two quizzes a week, a workshop and asynchronous lectures. However, I really liked the flipped system (I dont think I can retain that much information in just 1hr 15 of lecture without stopping and starting the lecture). Julie is so dedicated to the students in this course, and you can see that so much from the fact that she responds to slacks at 12:30am from panicking students to her bringing in baked goods and telling us recommendations around Cambridge every week. The TFs are also super good, and passionate. Everyone is willing to help.</td>

The lectures were not helpful, so I wouldn&#x27;t go. The PSets are long and repetitive, but easy enough if you are at least slightly understanding the material.

The PSETs are also VERY time&ndash;consuming. It&#x27;s not that hard, but it&#x27;s very time&ndash;consuming. <br/>My biggest advice: make your cheat sheet in advance for both the midterm and final!! (as in make it as the semester progresses) Also, spend a lot of time ensuring you understand every problem in the practice exam to ensure you&#x27;re set for the exam. Studying for exams for this class will take longer than you expect, so prepare accordingly.</td>

I think flipped classroom formats shouldn&#x27;t be used for an introductory course as large and as general as STAT100, since there was practically no point in coming to lecture, and learning from a video for introductory statistics and R is counterintuitive. I also feel like the entire course, I never learned how to independently tackle an entire Pset by myself, but both the midterm and the final were doing pretty much exactly this.  I think the final should have probably been a project just based off the way the class was taught, and the balance of learning statistics and learning R was not handled very well. I feel like I barely learned any R, and much of my stats knowledge remains pretty shallow. I can&#x27;t say I recommend the course with the current setup, but it is a requirement for most? Maybe take it in spring with a different professor?</td>

If you already have taken AP stats, I think this course is fine because it hits on the same topics but just adds coding on top of it. The coding was the most difficult because I didn&#x27;t have any prior experience. It was quite a bit of work for an introduction class. But, it did really help with getting the R coding skills which is super important. If it&#x27;s not the flipped classroom model, I would recommend with more enthusiasm. The 3 hour midterm (in&ndash;person) felt really inconvenient because it essentially felt like timed coding, which is not reasonable for first&ndash;time coders.

Yes, the content is difficult, but I feel like there could have been more support for all students in the course. I appreciate the extension days and the clear communication the team had.

STAT 100 will equip you well with the basic knowledge you need for picking apart data and coding in R which will become so helpful to you in this class and beyond. Thus, regarding the amount of knowledge and skills you will take away from the course, STAT 100 is completely worth it. However, this class is very challenging and the PSETs are very long, so it is essential that you manage your time well this semester and you dedicate a decent amount of your time each week to internalize the material. You DO NOT want to fall behind! The teaching staff is very accommodating and does its best to support the students, so you will have plenty of support throughout the class. Do not worry about learning R if that is your biggest concern. You will learn without too many hiccups because most people come in being new to R and things are usually fine. The teaching team is also very fair with grading PSETs&#x2F;exams and gives lots of opportunities to redeem missed points and learn from past mistakes. Take advantage of these opportunities! Also, I will say that you should be aware of the flipped&ndash;classroom model of this class if it continues into future semesters. If flipped&ndash;classroom is not really your style of learning, you will have to find a way to work with it this semester&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;it is crucial that you watch these videos if you want to get even an ounce of what is being taught to you each week. The videos can be confusing at times (and hard to engage with), so really utilize office hours and class hours (which are mainly used for doing practice problems this semester that I took the class) to really get yourself back on track.

First half of the course is very coding heavy and second half brings in more conceptual&#x2F;stat stuff, where it will be helpful for you to have taken AP Stat. Neither (coding experience, AP stat) are necessary, but may make it easier. Start p&ndash;sets early, go to office hours (TFs have said its nearly impossible to complete psets without office hours). Labs aren&#x27;t necessary but will be good practice when studying for the midterm&#x2F;final. Start &quot;cheat&ndash;sheet&quot; immediately and make sure you keep up with it and make it organized throughout the sem &ndash;&ndash; will make studying for midterm&#x2F;final so much easier. Totally do&ndash;able and doesn&#x27;t need to be such a huge workload, just stay on top of it.</td>

The psets are way too long. If you get remotely behind, your semester could be over.  You have to take this course for econ concentration which I only understand if you are studying economics with the intent to be an actual economist which isn&#x27;t everyone in the concentration.

Way too much unnecessary busy work. And the weekly quizzes were kinda stressful with odd due dates, and in the end it was just a waste of time. You will learn everything in section so finding a good TF is very important. Make sure you have a study group, because if not honestly this class is pretty close to impossible, without going insane.  I think Julie is a really cool teacher and an awesome person, but that class model just was not it.</td>

But DO NOT assume (as I did) that this will be &quot;easy&quot; because it&#x27;s &quot;just Stat 100.&quot; This is on par with a somewhat difficult AP class in high school, ie, totally possible to do well, but you need to be on top of things and spend a decent amount of time asking questions&#x2F;understanding, TRULY understanding, the material outside of class. <br/><br/>To its credit, this class has some good things. The TFs are great, there&#x27;s always OH, and Julie is hyper&ndash;active on the slack. The Psets can be a pain if you start them late (like I did for all of them), but totally manageable if you budget time properly.<br/><br/>However, large parts of this course need to be reworked. Julie would often introduce new topics poorly and fail to fully explain the intuition behind them (for example, power, relationship between CI and p&ndash;value). For a class that claims to try to incentivize active learning via a flipped classroom, you spent almost two hours a week watching a video of the lecture with no chance to ask questions in real&ndash;time, and then spend 30&ndash;45 minutes every week in &quot;lab&quot; passively watching (or frantically trying to code&#x2F;follow along) as Julie reviews the lesson from that week in a &quot;demo.&quot; You get maybe 10&ndash;15 minutes in &quot;lab&quot;&#x2F;in&ndash;person lecture each week to actually work on the &quot;labs&quot; with the help of TFs.  They need to get rid of the virtual lecture, break things up into two in&ndash;person lectures a week, and have people actively do practice problems in the middle of lecture. <br/><br/>These things are frustrating, but in truth the PSets do help you understand the material, and everyone should take Stat100. It allows you to understand so much more about the news&#x2F;studies&#x2F;science. Too bad Jude S doesn&#x27;t get to teach it.</td>

The class is extremely coding&ndash;heavy with little emphasis on actual statistics concepts. I think the biggest thing I took away from this class was a good baseline understanding of R and how to code in it. I learned the basics of certain statistical methods, but nothing was ever covered too deep. I think it&#x27;s a great class for someone just looking to dip their toes into statistics. Despite being an introductory class, this class is definitely very intensive. As a flipped classroom format, I spent so much time watching lecture videos, finishing two quizzes a week, and going to office hours on top of attending lecture &amp; section every week. Be prepared to spend a lot of time with this class, whether that&#x27;s sitting in actual class, struggling through the problem sets, etc. Overall, I had a good experience with the teaching team and learning about R&#x2F;stats and would recommend this class to someone who&#x27;s looking for that!</td>

Seriously. This one was way too time&ndash;consuming, the exams were horrible, and psets were super long. Also it was a flipped classroom (ugh). All in all, this is not the simple concentration req it used to be &ndash; it was my most time&ndash;consuming class this semester. Genuinely do not recommend unless you absolutely have to.</td>
