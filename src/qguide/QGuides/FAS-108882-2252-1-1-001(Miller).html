You have about 5 things you have to turn in weekly, but none of them take longer than 2 hours, I probably spent about 7 hours a week on AP50 but I will say it&#x27;s relatively easy work, nothing that will terribly stress you out. The course is a lot more applicable than say the Physics 15 series (a lot more theoretical) and honestly takes about the same amount of time, it just depends on whether you want to spend 7 hours a week doing a theoretical physics 15 pset or 7 hours doing silly AP50 assignments like readings, tutorials, etc. No exams, just a few final projects. I really did love my teams (randomized) that I did my projects with and that&#x27;s probably one of the better aspects of this course. If you have a bad team, you&#x27;re kind of screwed but I was fortunate enough to have great teammates each time. You&#x27;ll have opportunities to make up assignments you mess up on, just make sure you do it in a timely manner as I forgot to for a couple and it nearly screwed me over... Sometimes the course heads give out contradicting information. You can kind of tell the teaching staff don&#x27;t like each other that much or don&#x27;t get along because they&#x27;ll say different things and just be like &quot;ignore what X said earlier&quot;, which is a little frustrating because they should probably talk in private before giving us contrasting instructions, but it&#x27;s a little entertaining. Kind of feels like watching your parents fight sometimes. The course is a little annoying but so is every physics course, and it&#x27;s probably the lesser of the evils.</td>

			<td class="TabularBody_LeftColumn" headers="comment-2_b2026860-25c7-43ee-b3d9-a406b8cb751c">This class is A LOT of work. You definitely have to plan your week around this class, as there are many assignments to complete and missing one can drop a letter grade. However, do not be scared &ndash; it is totally doable. I was taking five classes this semester with AP50B, and it worked out just fine. The class is completion&ndash;based, so to obtain a good grade you just have to submit everything ON TIME, even though you are not 100% confident that it is correct. The grading scale is essentially a 1,2, and 3. You have to meet specifications (a 2) on all assignments, and assignments that do not meet specifications can be made up (which is very nice).  My biggest advice is to read the syllabus very thoroughly, just so you are aware of what is expected and how everything works. I took PS2 in the fall and AP50B in the spring, and I AM SO HAPPY WITH MY DECISION. Although there is a lot of work, I prefer that over being stressed about taking an exam.</td>

Coming from PS2 there is more work and more to keep up with in AP50 but the peace&ndash;of&ndash;mind grade&ndash;wise is nice to have but if that&#x27;s not as important and&#x2F;or you&#x27;re a great test&ndash;taker PS3 may be the better option.</td>

			<td class="TabularBody_LeftColumn" headers="comment-2_b2026860-25c7-43ee-b3d9-a406b8cb751c">I had a horrible experience with this class, though I likely wouldn&#x27;t have gone back and chosen a different physics class. I had two completely incompetent groups, which resulted in me having to complete a bulk of the work (especially with Skills Sessions and projects). There is no accountability for people who are late, which makes the entire team dynamic suffer. There were often not enough TFs to go around to check answers, which resulted in people being late to the second half of class. TFs sometimes gave conflicting answers, which made learning very difficult. Additionally, Robert was awful as a course head.  Not only did he leave extremely harsh feedback on assignments and grill students for long periods of time (50 minutes on one question in my case), he told my group that we were &quot;cognitively impaired&quot; and that there would be &quot;diminishing returns&quot; to keep explaining things. This is unacceptable for a professor to say to students trying to learn the material. If you&#x27;re willing to do the work, yeah, things will turn out alright in the end, but the process of getting there has been mentally and emotionally exhausting.</td>

I thought I was good at deadlines but realized that was for normal classes with normal types of deadlines and workflow. This class is insane and something is due EVERY SINGLE DAY. If you miss one thing you are at risk of your grade dropping an entire letter grade. The teaching staff does not teach nor provide any sort of teaching, guidance, or advice going into the various modules. They are also overly strict about meeting specifications in order to receive a particular grade.  It is really unfortunate that most students leave this course having learned nothing, being unclear about what they did or why, because there is no guidance from staff. If you actually want to learn physics, please take PS2&#x2F;3&#x2F;12 etc. I did not care to actually learn so I took it, but if I wanted to learn things I&#x27;d be very disappointed with this class.</td>

			<td class="TabularBody_LeftColumn" headers="comment-2_b2026860-25c7-43ee-b3d9-a406b8cb751c">In this course, you have to be committed to routinely checking your grades, Slack, and course announcements to ensure you haven&#x27;t missed work. Most weeks include around 5 assignments that take around 5 hours to complete&ndash; and 2 three hour in class meetings to review&#x2F;complete work. My biggest stress to future students is to make sure you never miss a class if possible, and if necessary try to check your amount of &quot;tokens&quot; and what is happening that day to try to work around it. An example&ndash; you have to complete Skills Session in class, which are essentially mini labs that require attendance to complete. If you miss those, you would be required to submit either a doctor&#x27;s note or a &quot;token&quot; (you get 6 of these each semester and each one can be used to makeup a late assignment) to come in at a later scheduled time to make it up. This can be annoying and tedious to do on top of your other work and commitments, so try not to miss class. You also have &quot;check&ndash;ins&quot;, which are 3 small meetings twice a week ( a total of 6) to review your answers on 2 separate assignments with your classmates and a teacher. You can miss one day of these (aka 3 check&ndash;ins) before it makes your grade drop from an A to a B. These are just some examples of the importance of attendance in this course&ndash; missing just one day without following up or submitting a late&ndash;token can drop your grade by a letter.</td>

You need to be very organized so that you don&#x27;t miss any deadlines.<br/><br/>My biggest issue with this class actually has to do with some of the teaching staff.<br/><br/>On one hand, some of the TFs (e.g., Alex Buzali) are incredibly supportive and deserving of acknowledgment. Kelly Miller, one of the professors, is absolutely amazing. Her positive approach to teaching genuinely made me want to learn more about physics. On the other hand, however, you sometimes have TFs that are passive aggressive and impatient, which make check&ndash;ins very difficult.<br/>Robert Haussman, another APPHY 50B professor, fostered an especially hostile and unwelcoming learning environment. His backhanded remarks and unnecessarily intimidating behavior made it very difficult to engage in the course. I’ve never had a professor so insistent on making students feel ashamed for not already having mastered the material. The environment he created was so uncomfortable, actually, that some students intentionally delayed marking their tutorials as complete, just to avoid being assigned to him for check&ndash;ins. His presence alone introduced enough stress that it actively discouraged participation and engagement.<br/><br/>Overall, I have no regrets on taking this course over PS 3. However, it could still definitely be improved!</td>

The slack was often filled with questions students can use common sense for or could be answered by reading past announcements. The students were insufferable, an assignment wasn&#x27;t graded yet and someone asked if they missed grades being released which shows the thinking skills of these students. Overall, though, I enjoyed the class a lot more than I thought I was going to. Robert isn&#x27;t the best instructor as will likely be mentioned by other comments but he is fair and I have never had a bad experience with him.

It truly is the work you put in though, make sure you do all the readings and you&#x27;re being attentive to the content. Yes it can be an easy A but please put effort into learning the content if you&#x27;re an engineer. <br/><br/>I will say, the teaching staff can be a little hard to work with sometimes. Sometimes they deviate from the syllabus and make their own rules along the way. Nowhere in the syllabus does it mention things about how much time something should take you, how much tardiness constitutes as an absence, and how late you can turn in makeups if asked for an extension and not given a proper date.  Be prepared for random rules to come into play and honestly the best way forward is to work with the teaching team and basically suck up to them because if not they will make your life miserable and you will not get an A. <br/><br/>Other than that,  it is really in everyone&#x27;s best interest to put effort into the class and try, it makes your group so much better.</td>

There are no exams in this class, so one of the upsides of this course is that you can learn for the sake of learning and not having to constantly worry about being correct. Put in your best effort in all of the assignments and you will be more than fine. Make sure to check the guidelines of each assignment (there are a lot of them, so another thing is to be on top of your stuff and watch out for the deadlines &ndash; once you get into the swing of the semester, you&#x27;ll have a rhythm going so each week&#x27;s work pretty much becomes second nature to you) and make sure you meet the expectations before submitting. You would not want to go back and fix a bunch of things because that can be annoying when this class hands you so much to do each week. <br/>You also work in teams throughout AP50. Personally, my experience had been great because my teammates were all very collaborative. If you are willing to give a shot at working with others for a semester, this class is for you! <br/>AP50 can feel like a roller coaster and sometimes learning the concepts can feel less effective and more confusing than you would expect from a normal class, but at the end of the day, the teamwork aspect, the teaching team just wanting you to put in your best effort, and you getting to be curious without having to worry about correct answers makes this class worth it. One other thing &ndash; if they don&#x27;t fix this in the future, expect to be introduced to the physics concepts each week by reading a textbook off of Perusall where you basically are asked to make annotations on what you read. Personally, I did not find that very helpful because I don&#x27;t learn by reading from a textbook (it&#x27;s pretty dry as you can imagine). There are no lectures, so a lot of the learning you do comes from doing the reading and then testing your knowledge out with the Tutorials and Challenges each week. You do Tutorials and Challenges individually and then with your team. While they do work in reinforcing your understanding to a certain degree (like when you complete them alone based on what you understand and then after the team session you learn from the mistakes you may have made), you can expect struggles on your way through. Overall, I would say AP50B is a great way to get your physics requirement done as well as getting some of the other benefits I have mentioned, but the way the assignments are set up can very much feel like ineffective busy work. So choose based on what matters more to you. :)</td>

The groups are also randomly assigned which completely changes your experience in the class (if you get a good vs. bad group).

Stay on top of the problem sets and quizzes, as they’re excellent opportunities to reinforce what you&#x27;ve learned. Don’t hesitate to ask questions and utilize office hours, as the professors are incredibly knowledgeable and supportive. The course really emphasizes connecting theory to real&ndash;world applications, so be ready to see how physics plays a crucial role in engineering and technology.

However, this comes with the benefit that AP 50a&#x2F;b does NOT contain exams, and only grades you on the TEAM component of assignments. As a result, you have a chance to correct all of your work before submitting it to be evaluated. Additionally, if there are still mistakes, you have the chance to do markups to correct it, ensuring that you perform well in the class.<br/><br/>Overall, the reality is that AP50a&#x2F;b will GUARANTEE you an A if you submit your work on time. The structure is outlined very early in the course, and the requirements are extremely straightforward. However, you must stay on track for all assignment and compete EVERYTHING on time. If you fall behind and either miss ONE assignment or have ONE dissatisfactory grade (and fail to make it up in a reasonable amount of time), it will automatically bump you down a full letter grade. However, as long as you complete all assignments on time and follow the course structure perfectly, there is no way you can go wrong.<br/><br/>Notably, the learning atmosphere within AP50b remains one of the course’s biggest weaknesses, especially as it relates to specific members of the teaching team. While a majority of the teaching staff are supportive and work hard to create an encouraging atmosphere, there are very evident exceptions to this. Instead, the actions of some members of the teaching team continue to intimidate and discourage students, leading to the creation of an extremely toxic environment that fails to promote learning. <br/><br/>One of the course heads, Robert Haussman, is the most unsupportive individual in the entire class. Although he seems to have a calm and encouraging personality when you first meet him, this is merely a facade. When students ask questions on Slack or in&ndash;person, he often responds in the most passive aggressive tone. For example, when a student asked about the progress of grade snapshots (a grade preview that the teaching staff typically provide at multiple time points throughout the semester to keep students on track), he chose to respond that he did not have sufficient time to fulfill this and told the student to go calculate it themselves, as the sheet to do so has “been there all year” long. This highlights his complete disregard of the needs of students and decision to blame students for a shortcoming of his own. Then, during check&ndash;ins, his discouraging personality is even more evident, with Robert often staying with groups for 30+ minutes on something that should realistically only take 10&ndash;15 minutes maximum. Beyond the questions asked within the assignment, he chooses to ask students follow&ndash;up after follow&ndash;up. While this would normally be acceptable (especially if used to try and further student understanding), he often becomes extremely disapproving and notably disgruntled when students have the smallest ounce of confusion. Having an instructor like this not only FAILS to create a helpful environment that facilitates student engagement and learning, but also TURNS STUDENTS AWAY from asking for help when they need it. Looking forward, this is an area that needs significant improvement, or AP50 will continue failing to meet the needs of its students. <br/><br/>Unfortunately, this issue also persists with some of the course TFs. One TF in particular, Ri Dresser, is very similar to Robert and also leads to the creation of an unsupportive and toxic atmosphere in class. As one of the TFs that regularly does check&ndash;ins, they are known throughout the class as being one of the harshest graders, often giving VERY low scores to students for making simple mistakes. For context, check&ndash;ins are graded between 0&ndash;3, with 0 indicating no effort (or not completing the assignment), 1 indicating minimal effort, 2 indicating satisfactory work and effort (even if some of the work is wrong), and 3 indicating work that extends beyond the expectations of the class. With this in mind, 2 is the “normal” score that students should expect to receive as long as they present their work in a reasonable manner. However, Ri has a tendency to give VERY low scores, ranging from 1.3 to 0.8 to even 0.5, despite there being no valid reason for doing so. In fact, there are days where Ri was shown to give consecutive “failing” scores ranging between 0.5&ndash;0.8 to SEVERAL groups back to back, being the ONLY TF to do so. Beyond just the grading, Ri is also very unapproachable due to their attitude. In class, Ri oftentimes grips their head in agony and sighs loudly when students indicate confusion. In effect, this makes students extremely uncomfortable and creates an environment that appears to punish making mistakes (or being unsure about something), as opposed to encouraging learning and individual growth. Similar to the note above about Robert, the fact that members of the teaching staff act in this manner completely TURNS AWAY students from being passionate and wanting to learn physics. Instead, all it causes is students purposely trying to avoid these members of the teaching staff, knowing that asking them for help will only lead to further judgement and frustration. <br/><br/>Despite my aforementioned complaints about AP50b, credit is due where credit is deserved &ndash; the saving grace for this course and silver lining amidst tons of issues is Kelly Miller, one of the new course heads. This semester, Kelly was introduced as one of the new instructors and began taking over the AP50 series. She will also be the primary course head going forward for both AP50a&#x2F;b. As an instructor, Kelly is one of the most SUPPORTIVE individuals I have ever met, oftentimes trying to uplift students and encourage them to continue achieving higher. When students have questions, she acknowledges their needs and works to improve their understanding with compassion. As students bring up points of frustration with the class, she remains extremely receptive (and RESPONSIVE) to feedback, piloting new initiatives to try and fix the weak points of the course. Lastly, Kelly is just extremely positive &ndash; always seeming genuinely PASSIONATE about the course and as if she wants to see her students thrive. Knowing that Kelly will be permanently taking over the course gives me hope that AP50 will change going forward, with the intent of better supporting the needs of students. As a whole, Kelly should be seen as a role model to AP50 teaching staff on what a genuinely outstanding instructor looks like!<br/><br/>Similarly positive things can also be said about the following TFs, who have gone above and beyond to make the class an enjoyable and learning class environment: Tayna Camargo, Alex Buzali, Soy Choy, and Anna Luong. Thank you to each of these amazing individuals for making AP50b more tolerable, and a better learning environment (despite the aforementioned flaws).<br/><br/>With this in mind, I think AP50a&#x2F;b is a great option if you are looking to ensure a good grade in physics and can accept the faults of the course. However, go in with a realistic expectation on the time needed to complete assignments, and an understanding on some of the weak points of the course overall. To any student choosing between PS 2&#x2F;3 and AP 50a&#x2F;b, good luck &ndash; I wish you the best of luck. Physics is a lot regardless of which course you choose, but work hard and you will get through it.</td>

You do 6&ndash;7 assignments every week, completely dominating your life. You lowest grade on a SINGLE assignment is your grade for the entire course. Certain members of the teaching staff seem out to get students, worsening the learning experience.</td>

There are many assignments, and the textbook at least for me did not really help me learn.  Also, so much of this class is reliant on a group, and if you don&#x27;t have a good group or if someone isn&#x27;t showing up, there&#x27;s not much you can do about it and it can negatively impact you. If you want to take this class, make sure you say super organized and don&#x27;t miss assignments.</td>

It does feel incredibly tedious at times but I did feel like I learned a lot from the tutorials and sometimes the skills sessions. I also loved the community, it was so fun to see my friends all the time in class and build a strong relationship.</td>
