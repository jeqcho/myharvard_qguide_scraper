There are 3 special Thursdays where you can experiment with different teaching methods and I personally find them very intriguing! Although I ended up with liking the most traditional ones out of all, I still find this form of class experiment should be more popular and it was fun knowing what is the most efficient for me. Although there is no MQC (I find out through my friend what MQC means only after 2&#x2F;3 of the class has passed), the resources are enough to keep me on the track. There are also many ways to make up for missing attendances, dropping exercises so it’s get chiller sometimes. I really love the Edfinity assignments since they keep me invested and also allow me to dig deeper into class materials. I am an international freshman and have no previous with either proof or american math materials but I can say that I understand most of the things going on.<br/><br/>Bad: I think I don’t really like the staff work of this course. The course assistants are all undergrads and sometimes when they explain things for me I don’t believe they entirely understand the course materials. The sections are held by teaching fellows but most of them are very shy with barely any teaching skills so I didn’t have motivation or hearing ability to sit through the whole section at all. Exams of this course are incredibly questionable difficulty wise. Since I am a freshman, I didn’t know how the scale work so when I received my first midterm’s grade (75) I almost had a stroke and lost trust in my math ability but then it turned out there is a strong curve and it’s the only reason I did not drop this course. For later midterms, it worked the same for me. Though I know there would be a curve, it’s still very stressful for me. The grade distribution is quite funny also because 88% goes to midterms and final (which I don’t like because it was quite stressing me out).<br/><br/>Ambigious: Although there is only 1 PSET&#x2F;week, it is very hard compared to inclass exercises. I have mixed feelings about this so might no further comments. It also only has 7% contribution to the final grade so it should not be that stressful.</td>

It is difficult in a sense but once you have the fundamental understanding of one topic, the next ones should build on that. Midterms and finals were on the fair but there weren&#x27;t many questions &ndash; as such, careless mistakes or the inability to do one could cost a substantial amount of your grade.

Be aware that there are three midterms and one final exam, so you should always study the material regularly, The grading can be harsh but you can ask for regrades. This course is definitely more difficult than the 21 sequence, but if you want to concentrate in math or related fields (physics, cs) take this class, it prepares you more than 21 in my opinion.</td>

Especially for freshman, 22a does not include topics like matrix and vector operations or vector spaces as prerequisites, but you will be scrambling a little bit to catch up if you have never studied these and similar topics. Many of the students in this course have taken &#x27;adjacent&#x27; classes (e.g. high school linear algebra, advanced physics, multi&ndash;variable calculus), so they will adjust more quickly to the flow of the course than students for whom these ideas are completely new.</td>

And the worst part of it is, even if you do all of the above, you will STILL be reading the textbook to learn the content of the course. This is horrible, because I thought the content in the class was genuinely SO interesting. I took 21A previous to taking this class — and I cannot recommend the 21A series more.

Additionally, I would note that your experience in this course will be extremely variable based on your individual strengths and knowledge. I have friends who worked really hard to study the content and ended with a B+, and I have other friends who didn’t really pay attention in class and still got a high A. If you’ve been traditionally strong at math, I think this course is truly worth it and deserves a go — especially if you are taking it for a concentration like Applied Math. However, if you are studying a less math&ndash;reliant subject like Computer Science and know you have to work harder than your classmates on performing well in math, I would be thoughtful in weighing going the 21 or 22 route. I think it is still possible to get an A in the latter case, but it will require more effort on your end and a significant time investment (think <br/><br/>Here are my thoughts on different areas of this course — please note that much of this is subjective to whether the lecturer remains the same next fall. <br/><br/>There are several areas where this course needs improvement: <br/>1. Class pacing: The structure of every class isn&#x27;t strictly a lecture; instead you&#x27;re given class worksheets and you complete the problems in tandem with the lecturer. I have generally liked this type of class structure before, but I think it has meant that a lot of proof strategies weren&#x27;t explicitly stated in class and instead required students to develop their own strategies outside of class. This course is marketed as a beginner linear algebra course with an introduction to proofs, so proofs are incorporated throughout all the course concepts. However, the integration of the two halves of this course needs some significant reworking. Most of the proofs that were done in class, especially in the second half of the course, were significantly more difficult than any problem that would come up on a problem set, let alone an exam &ndash;&ndash; and with a tangential connection to the actual application of the concept itself. I understand that these proofs were intended to show us how mathematicians originally derived the theorems and equations that we were using, but without any explanation of what the actual theorem does, it is impossible for us to understand what equation we&#x27;re even attempting to derive or what the goal of it is. Additionally, after the 10th class or so, we almost completely left the Hammack book of proofs since we had presumably finished learning the most important proof tools and methods. However, if one of the problems in a later class requires us to use a lemma, then I would presume it is necessary to explain what a lemma is before using it. Overall, I felt that most of the proofs that we did in class were just Wood showing us a bunch of cool moves he could do without explaining the actual strategy of why he chose those specific moves to do &ndash;&ndash; while I was personally able to build a strong understanding of how to do proofs through my own practice and the problem sets, I think this has been a common critique among me and my friends in the class. <br/>Additionally, we never got through all of the course pack problems in each class. This meant that we didn&#x27;t get the lecturer&#x27;s explanation about these concepts, many of which were proof&ndash;based problems that it would have been nice to have him walk us through. <br/>2. Problem sets: The problem sets for this class weren&#x27;t obscenely difficult, and sometimes dare I say fun, but there would usually be around one question on each problem set that had a solution that required such a weird concept or reworking using equation rearrangement tricks and methods that we had never even been exposed to in the class or textbook. The course assistants ended up being hugely crucial in fixing these areas, but I talked to several who even admitted that some of the problems had some particularly nasty algebra and didn&#x27;t really do anything to build our understanding of the linear algebra concepts from class. I think it&#x27;s worth re&ndash;examining certain problem set questions that were more reliant on these types of weird algebra tricks and replacing them with something more substantive. For example, I found the true&#x2F;false questions on exams to be particularly difficult because they required a flexible and comprehensive understanding of the connection between matrices, linear independence, rank, and similarity that we truly had not built up anywhere else in the course. <br/>3. Exams: As a relatively fast exam taker, these exams favor those who understand the exam structure and structure their study schedule around it &ndash;&ndash; simply understanding the course concepts is not enough. I wish more practice exams were available before the exams and that the available practice exams were more analogous to the difficulty of the actual exams. I felt that most of the exam content was typically fair, in the sense that you could predict what was on it, but I do think that there was usually one problem per exam that was about a concept that we had only spent a maximum of 10 minutes (or even less) of class on. <br/>4. Overall conceptual understanding: I generally think that the explanation of the linear algebra concepts needed to be better connected to the geometric representation of vectors (especially for the explanations about change of basis). My biggest critique is that we learned about diagonalization before eigenvalues and eigenvectors when it should really be the reverse. When I took linear algebra in high school, eigenvalues and eigenvectors were some of the first concepts that we learned about, and we definitely learned about them before getting into any applications and matrices constructed using them. It&#x27;s difficult to understand where the diagonal matrix even comes from without an explanation of these two concepts. <br/>5. The textbook: I didn&#x27;t end up finding this useful and only referenced it around exam time. Their explanations of some of the class concepts made more sense than how it was presented in the course pack, but generally, you were good to go for the exams as long as you understood the course pack content. This textbook also has a really weak answer key (many of the solutions are not provided), so it doesn&#x27;t provide very good exam practice. <br/>6. Sections: The section worksheets weren&#x27;t that strong, especially in the beginning, but they did improve over time. I think that sections were the best place where I built the most exam&ndash;relevant knowledge since the problems that I encountered in them were the closest in line with the exam content. I appreciated that he explained a lot of the WHY behind certain concepts, such as why we would introduce the concepts of vector spaces when they seemed to be the exact same as the traditional vector work that we had been doing before — these were things that should’ve been explained in class. <br/><br/>Overall, this class has recently seen high yearly turnover with its lecturer, and while I can see the merits of what this course was trying to get at, I don&#x27;t think the implementation and course support truly did much justice for it. I will say that this course was pretty stressful for many of my peers, especially since it’s hard to predict your grade since the grade distribution and cutoffs change pretty drastically with each exam. However, this was also the course that confirmed to me that I want to concentrate in Applied Math, so I do think it has its merits and is a class worth your time if you have never done proofs before.</td>

Much of the class had previous experience in linear algebra and&#x2F;or abstract math, beyond Calc. BC level of understanding. The final exam was incredibly difficult and required content further than what was covered in lessons. The curve is not very forgiving. Exams are most of the grade and grading is harsh&ndash;&ndash;due to the nature of the exam problems, a small gap in knowledge equates to a huge loss of points on the exam.

During his office hours (which my schedule rarely permitted me to attend) and his in&ndash;person special Thursday lecture, it is extremely apparent how polite and nice he is. Dr. Wood is actually a very good professor, and that was most apparent when attending his small&ndash;group in&ndash;person Special Thursday lecture. You can tell he is passionate and excited about linear algebra, but I believe he would be even more excited in an applications course, as you could see his eyes sparkle during the last lecture about principal component analysis. I truly wish him the best, and I believe with time, this course has potential to be an amazing resource for students interested in linear algebra and proof&ndash;writing.<br/><br/>But for students who are not impressed by &quot;potential,&quot; please thoroughly educate yourself in what you are getting into taking this course. This course is do&ndash;able. Curve is reasonable. I took this course with only Calculus BC, and at first it seemed that I was behind, but by the end, I felt completely on&ndash;par with my classmates who have already taken linear algebra before. Course structure, however, will hurt you if you are not extremely careful. Monday&ndash;Wednesday&ndash;Friday and problem set work id to be expected for MATH 22A. However, this class takes several liberties in course structure, including mandatory section (where you pick your time) and mandatory Thursday. Mandatory Thursday lecture requires you to&ndash;&ndash;as the name suggests&ndash;&ndash;take special lectures on Thursdays about once a month. This is not only extremely inconvenient (even though there are online lectures), it is incredibly confusing. This content will later be put on midterm exams (barely acknowledged in class), so it&#x27;s basically a big &quot;figure it out.&quot; Along with weekly problem sets, online Edfinity assignments are due every week. These assignments cannot often be completed without outside help. However, these are mostly computational assignments, and therefore are not also reflected on exams. Additionally, problem sets are not reflective of actual exam contents. However, this is a relief: problem sets practiced proof&ndash;writing and proof skill, but they were incompletable without help of a CA. Every single CA in this class deserves a lifetime of happiness and blessings. Absolutely amazing people. Exams are a hit&ndash;or&ndash;miss. By the second midterm, you will realize whether or not you can be successful on the exams: they are an entirely different beast than problem sets and in&ndash;class practice. They are easier than both, but they are by no means easy. This means that the only way to effective study for an exam is to take a posted practice exam and hope the structure is at least similar.<br/><br/>My tips if you have to take this class: go to Monday Math Night Office Hours for problem set help. Everyone is basically struggling on the same thing, you hang out for the hour or two and the majority (or all in most cases) of your pset is done. This is how I only spent 3 hours each week on the problem set. Go to Philip Wood&#x27;s office hours for conceptual questions. He knows linear algebra, but he just doesn&#x27;t have time during lecture to explain the areas that may be roughing you up. For studying for exams, use review sheets and go over definitions.</td>

If you have neither, it might be a struggle to stay on track, especially in the first few weeks when you&#x27;re learning proof methods and linear algebra. It&#x27;s by no means impossible, but expect to spend a lot of time on the course at the beginning.<br/><br/>2) The professor provides few opportunities for applying linear algebra to &quot;real&ndash;life&quot; situations — or for problem&ndash;solving at all, for that matter. We spend most of the time doing proofs, which is wonderful, but it means that you won&#x27;t be able to solve problems with the same fluidity you might if the course wasn&#x27;t proof&ndash;based. It also means that you won&#x27;t get the visual intuition for linear algebra, since the lecturer didn&#x27;t spend much time on that at all.</td>

Learning how to write proofs and linear algebra topics might be very difficult because of how this course was taught this semester. <br/><br/>I will say this course had some positives:<br/>&ndash; The teaching fellows and course assistants. The teaching assistants for this course were really great. They really helped supplement the overall experience of this course and answer questions that cleared any misunderstandings. The TFs were great in helping to understand the &quot;why&quot; behind the proofs covered in class because we often spent class time deriving the proof quickly without going through the motions and rationale of the proof. Shout out to Zak Adams, Layla Dawit, and Joshua Zhang. <br/>&ndash; The class size. The class is really big so you will make a lot of friends and meet a lot of really cool people! I have met my best friends over working on problem sets, studying for midterms, and engaging with the classroom. <br/>&ndash; You get out what you put in. I would say that this course is really reliant on how much effort you put it into it. Because of the large class size, it can by easy to lose focus in class.<br/><br/>Some of the negatives:<br/>&ndash; There are no visualizations in this class. Linear Algebra is a very visual subject and I was really surprised to see the lack of emphasis on this in the course.<br/>&ndash; I think the proofs are taught in an unintuitive way. We go through the derivation for proofs, but we never think about what they actually mean or how these results are brought up.  As such, I probably will not remember how to derive many of the proofs after this course and I feel like I am not too clear about some concepts in this course.<br/>&ndash; The grading scheme is really strange. It is very rewarding if you do bad on one exam and really good on another, but it is not rewarding if you consistently do good. How the curve is skewed was often unintuitive and even if you were in the A&ndash;range for all exams leading up to the final, you were left in the A&ndash; range at the final.

They will divide the students into 3 groups, some getting lecture, some asked to use Chat GPT,  some asked to read a PDF, and then you have to fill out a quiz before and after regarding the topic. Quite obvious it is an experiment, but then these materials are tested in the exam, and sometimes the only exposure you get to the material is through asking Chat GPT. How is that even allowed?</td>

The midterm exams were on par with or easier than the average pset, with a very large curve. There were, however, 3 midterms. The grading system is not so straight forward with exams, but it is to the benefit of students (exams with higher scores count more towards your grade).<br/><br/>Some assignments are posted without indication; remember that there are extra assignments associated with tests (reflections and practice tests: &quot;Data Projects&quot;, which are big psets, around finals) as well as several days of learning you are expected to complete outside of designated class time.  There were extra classes strewn throughout the semester, during which we were alternatingly assigned to in person, AI, or textbook learning groups. This material was not later covered in class, but appeared (more often than other material) on exams. This was very obviously a study of how learning methods impact academic performance, but one that we did not consent to participate in and that covered a significant amount of material in a less&ndash;than&ndash;accessible way.<br/><br/>Sections were inconsistent. The one I found that worked with my schedule was moved to a different time, forcing me to shift my schedule around.

Dr. Wood moves extremely quickly through examples and would sometimes ask if everyone understood, and then move on without giving anyone time. His handwriting is also really hard to follow on the projector on top of all of his arithmetic mistakes. During lecture, mostly everyone either talks, watches movies, or plays Roblox, making it even harder to actually learn something new in lecture.<br/><br/>I love linear algebra, and this class destroyed a bit of that love.

This year, for the majority of lectures, it felt more like a fast review, and you&#x27;d have to spend a lot of time self&ndash;studying with the textbook before each lecture in order to feel like you could keep up with what was going on in class. In lecture, many of the major concepts were glossed over and only formally introduced by their definitions, instead of being carefully broken down into simple terms. I often found that I&#x27;d be much better served taking the 75 minutes and spending it self&ndash;studying with the course textbook as opposed to going to lecture, but attendance at lectures was mandatory.  The problem sets aren&#x27;t exactly tied to the course material for the first half of the semester and can seem more of a side quest at times than something that actually helps you feel more prepared for exams and more confident with the content taught in lecture.  I came into this class with a heavy math background, though I had little prior experience with linear algebra. I figured that the proof&ndash;writing would be the most difficult part of the course, but you get used to it pretty quickly. It doesn&#x27;t seem to be nearly as taxing as it is for 25 or 55, though I still found this part of the course to be the most interesting and well taught. Surprisingly, I found the linear algebra content of the course to be more difficult because it simply involved a lot of notation that wasn&#x27;t thoroughly broken down in lecture. If you have lots of time outside of this course to dedicate to learning the content through the course text, I think you&#x27;ll do perfectly fine. However, if you&#x27;re taking other classes that take up a lot of your time, it may become difficult to find the time to master the necessary concepts before an exam. Exams were oftentimes stressful and the grading is very particular. The professor for this course seems to change often so I would recommend taking if you hear good things about the professor and possibly have taken linear algebra before or have some experience with it. The proof writing is doable and  eventually becomes interesting. The CAs were fantastic my year and love to help in any way possible, so I would highly recommend going to Office Hours, even if you don&#x27;t have pset questions and just need to reinforce the content from lecture.</td>

Having come in with little to no exposure to proofs, I learned a lot about logically reasoning through and thinking about mathematical proofs. As it relates to the coursework, proof&ndash;writing can be fun but also time&ndash;consuming and tasking if math is not a high priority. The workload is usually reasonable though and office hours help in chugging out proofs. The caveat is that the quality of office hours and sections heavily depend on the TFs and CAs running them. Some can be great and others not so much.<br/><br/>Content&ndash;wise, this course does not go too in&ndash;depth into its concepts. I came in having taken linear algebra before, so the content felt pretty introductory and was not hard.

If you do not, then I do not recommend this course since the concepts were not introduced well and I genuinely lack the foundational concept behind linear algebra. <br/><br/>This course was very difficult coming in with no linear algebra or proof experience. The lectures followed a worksheet that was projected on the screen and then the professor would go through the questions and concepts along with the worksheet. The issue is, the concept explanations were extremely brief&#x2F;incomplete and often times, we would never finish the worksheets in class which meant we had to learn the concepts on our own. The problem sets were mostly computational and often included concepts that were never mentioned in lecture.<br/><br/>The structure of the class was also extremely confusing. There are three midterms with no review periods which means you are learning new content for the next midterm in the class right before the midterm and that pattern continues for all three midterms. This makes it extremely easy to get behind on lecture content which derails the entire course. Because of the unstructured lectures and course overall, I had to spend hours trying to catch up on content. I had friends with experience that were able to keep up in the course but the lectures did not make sense to them either. <br/><br/>The grading is not transparent. The curve changed after every exam and days before the final exam, it changed dramatically despite the shifts in performance on the last midterm. Even after students had asked for exam data, none was published. The written homework, both the PSETs and the weekly online assessments, are weighed so little in the final grade which makes it so that exams essentially make up the entire grade. <br/><br/>The course support is quite good &ndash; the course assistants and TFs were available to discuss exam questions and were an integral part in completing PSETs every week. However, the sections were never assigned so my section ended up having 50+ people in the beginning, and turned more into a conceptual office hours which meant none of us really reinforced any of the concepts from lectures. <br/><br/>I would highly recommend that students without linear algebra experience consider all of the math class options.</td>

Coming in with no experience in either field, I was able to fully learn both topics through this class, particularly through the assignments that were given. However, if an introduction to linear algebra is all that you want, then Math 21B may be the better option, as although the proofs were interesting, they definitely made the course far more difficult than if it was just merely a computational course. <br/><br/>The teaching staff is Math 22A are its greatest benefit. There is such a wealth of knowledgeable and affable TFs and CAs that it is rare to have a problem for a long period of time, as there are so many office hours to attend, each with their own benefits. The section component, new for this year, had me initially doubting, but getting more one&ndash;on&ndash;one time with teaching staff on the material was definitely extremely useful &ndash; Mitchell and Clair Dai were both extremely good TFs! <br/><br/>The assignments and the exams are definitely fair, and the curve for the class is definitely a little difficult, but on the whole extremely fair. This is a course that, if you put in the work to understand the concepts, the grade is something that will reflect that. The assignments can take some time on some weeks, but getting through it with friends and CAs is part of the game with this course &ndash; you will meet some very close friends in this class because of it! <br/><br/>Philip Wood is a good instructor, but some of the lectures are slightly boring, so just be aware of that before choosing this course &ndash; attendance is also mandatory! Being such a large course, some of the lectures feel slightly impersonal and unengaging, so it is really up to you how much you choose to put into the course. <br/><br/>Overall, I would really recommend Math 22A but know that it is a very different class now than what it used to be, and make a judgment based on that information!</td>

That said, Math 22a is a good intermediate between 21a (which is pretty much all computational) and 25a (which is well&ndash;taught but significantly more rigorous and difficult).

At first, I decided to pay close attention to the lectures and the lecturer, but after the first and second midterms, I quickly realized that the reason I was not doing well is because the lectures do not properly cover the material at all. Professor Wood just does problems on the board without teaching students how to properly think through the problems, which does not work at all. In fact, reading through the textbook also revealed that some of the concepts we learned in lecture were taught in completely the wrong way. After this, I decided to not pay attention to the lecturer and learn on my own, and this resulted in me doing well on the third midterm and the final. My success in the course was due to the fact that I realized how terrible the professor is at teaching and learned how to teach the concepts to myself. If you are somehow that prioritizes productive lectures and a professor who actually teaches properly, DO NOT TAKE THIS COURSE.</td>

As someone who had taken linear algebra before, I thought that Math 25a would be a good fit, but that class is a different beast. The jump from 22 to 25 is astronomical. If you have never done proofs and don&#x27;t want to devote at least 20 hours a week to math, take 22 over 25. Although, I have many friends who took 25 with no proof experience and found it an incredibly rewarding experience, you just have to put in lots of time. Also if you care about your gpa, take 22. 22 will start of pretty easy, but don&#x27;t be fooled or get cocky because it picks up quick. It honestly is not too hard to get a good grade in this class because of the curve (tests are not curved but the overall grade is curved). This year, a 90 was an A and an 83 was an A&ndash;. To do well, don&#x27;t let any little points go to waste like problem sets or edfinity which are a free 12%. Unfortunately, despite psets being extremely engaging, interesting, and time consuming (each week taking about 8 hours), they are worth practically nothing, only 7% of your grade. And, they are graded extremely easily, with a 100 being any score above an 85. We also get 2 pset drops by doing &quot;data&ndash;projects&quot; which are fun and don&#x27;t take much time.  Best advice for this class would be to read the textbook before each class, work through some examples, stay on top of everything, and do the psets and online homework properly and you will be fine. Exams will only have stuff that is in the textbook or homework. A lot of people did not enjoy Dr. Wood as a professor, but he is such a nice guy and does a fine job. People were just mad because they had to put in time outside to learn the material, but that&#x27;s just the nature of the class. Work hard and don&#x27;t fall behind and you will do better than a lot of the class. Also, the final is worth at least 36% of your grade, which is good because if you did poorly for the first half, you can essentially save your grade by locking in for the final. This is bad though because if you don&#x27;t do well it could tank your grade. I am going to end with an A&ndash; and my only regrets are not keeping up with the material and not studying, because the content on exams should never feel shocking unless you genuinely don&#x27;t do any of the work which is what I did. Take this class over 21 because 1 pset a week is much better than 3, and you will learn much more about what pure math is while still keeping some applications. Good luck, you&#x27;ll be fine.</td>

This course may not be Math 25 or 55, but for someone who has never done Linear algebra, proofwriting, or set theory, you may very well still find yourself feeling a bit challenged. I took A LONG time to adapt to this course. Professor Wood is a great guy, and you can tell he is enthusiastic about what he does, but I must admit I felt so lost up until a few lectures after the second Midterm. To be entirely honest, I am not completely sure if its because I am just a slow student, or maybe lectures weren&#x27;t as clear as they could be, but let me tell you, I really suffered my first semester because of this class. I didn&#x27;t really know how to do the PSETS, the first two midterms didn&#x27;t go so great for me, and there were days when I severely doubted myself. I was also taking some other Pset courses, so the workload was definitely weighing on me, so if you are a first&ndash;year student also doing a lot of STEM&ndash;related courses, please make sure you know how to manage your time properly regardless of which math course you pick.<br/><br/>Just know this course might either be a complete breeze for you, or a warzone. It really depends on who you are. I certainly think Wood&#x27;s lectures were much better towards the latter half of the semester, and I found myself thoroughly enjoying them (a very stark contrast to what I felt towards the start of the semester). I also think that all things considered, because it was his first time teaching this course, it wasn&#x27;t that bad. I certainly believe he will do a better job next fall, and well, I have enough faith in this that I&#x27;m sticking with 22b and not dropping to 21a. If you do end up taking this course and struggle, please please please go to office hours. They saved me, and they will save you too. The CAs and TFs for this course were amazing (shout out to Zak, Josh, and Mitchell), and Dr. Wood is also particularly helpful and insightful during his office hours.<br/><br/>All in all, like I said before, really think about what math course you take. Do I regret taking 22a? Honestly, at first, I thought it would be a resounding yes, but honestly, the course grew on me. Yeah I struggled a ton, and you might too, but it&#x27;s in those moments where you truly learn who you are as a person and a student. The truth is, I may not leave this course with the greatest grade in the world, but I learned things from Wood&#x27;s lectures, I learned things from the other students I worked with, and I learned a lot from my study sessions. So I guess take 22a if you&#x27;re like me, unsure about where to start with math at Harvard, not wanting to do something as extreme as 25 or 55, but wanting a little more to prepare you at the start of your college journey.</td>

			<td class="TabularBody_LeftColumn" headers="comment-2_c4e82f91-7fee-4a74-9969-4b89e9df520e">Unpopular opinion: I actually really enjoyed this course. The pace was reasonable, some problems on the problem sets were actually quite insightful, data projects were fun, and Dr. Wood is a really sweet person if you get to know him. People tended to stress about the midterms (I did too, and there were 3 of them), but they all ended up being much more reasonable than I thought, and the grading + curves were extremely lenient. As someone who with no linear algebra or proof background, I came away with a pretty solid foundation of both topics and feel much better equipped to take higher&ndash;level math&#x2F;applied math&#x2F;cs courses next semester. If you&#x27;re choosing between this and 21 (as I was), take this!! We only have 1 pset a week, and you knock it out pretty quickly if you go to office hours&#x2F;sections. The course staff was super helpful, many office hours were held, and the support system was robust.<br/><br/>Some caveats: read the textbook if you want to truly understand the content. I do have some issues with Wood&#x27;s teaching, since he glosses over concepts&#x2F;important terms quite quickly. Going to class having done the textbook readings will make you understand everything so much better. Exams make up a LARGE part of your grade (probably around 90%), so if you don&#x27;t do well on exams compared to take&ndash;home work, maybe reconsider.<br/><br/>Also, this class is pretty demanding in terms of time, with 3 classes a week + mandatory weekly sections + 3 extra Thursday classes spread throughout the semester. You will have regular online homework, but those are pretty straightforward to power through. If you&#x27;re already taking a heavy courseload and don&#x27;t want to dedicate time to math, then you will hate this class. But honestly my friends in 1b&#x2F;21a also spent significant time on their psets&#x2F;classes, so alternatives might not be significantly better.</td>

Class is not engaging or interesting at all. I would have much rather not gone to class but still do the work since the work itself is interesting. Dr.Wood does not provide geometric (or comprehensive) explanations whatsoever. Having 1 pset a week is the only thing that makes 22 more worthwhile than 21.</td>

Work did ramp up towards the end of the year but the class was not too demanding, though it may be challenging if you have little proofing experience. However, I would not recommend this course so long as Wood is still teaching. The lectures are bad and he is incredibly petty about students skipping, so expect to be forced to go to very mediocre lectures 3 days a week, and expect to be forced to conceptualize the material better using resources outside of class. If you&#x27;re considering taking 25 or 55, I STRONGLY encourage you to do so. I had a strong linear background entering this course but it had been a while so I wanted a refresher. I strongly regret taking this course over a more challenging math class. Even if you don&#x27;t have a strong math backgroud, I doubt you will find this course to be anything more than a slog generally, though some of the PSET questions are interesting at times.</td>

The lectures are not helpful and cover exactly the textbook sections that should be read for that day. If there are &quot;special Thursdays&quot; next year, make sure you actually understand the content because it will show up on exams. Check Edstem constantly because various Edfinity and PSET problems have mistakes, and corrections will be announced there.</td>
