That being said, writing the 3 papers for this class was actually very informative and you learn a lot doing a deep dive into some pretty interesting readings. Overall, there are some cool section discussions you can have and if your very into political theory and republicanism then maybe this class is worthwhile, but the no electronics in lecture with TFs who would be on constant look out even if a relative called you was a bit frustrating. It is hard to really stay focused unless the lectures are improved. Prof. Carpenter is super knowledgable so again, if this is your cup of tea then you can learn a lot</td>

			<td class="TabularBody_LeftColumn" headers="comment-2_73542c99-0000-4382-afd9-b7994839dbf9">I definitely learned a lot in this course. It&#x27;s super relevant to a general understanding of politics and political history. It&#x27;s definitely worth it for that, but it is definitely not a walk in the park. They assign a TON of readings, but you can get by just skimming&#x2F; reading the ones that matter for the paper. The midterm sucks but I was able to makeup my horrible midterm grade with section participation and the papers. Not the easiest GENED for sure.</td>

			<td class="TabularBody_LeftColumn" headers="comment-2_73542c99-0000-4382-afd9-b7994839dbf9">it takes an incredible amount of talent to take a subject as mundane as history and make it even more boring. Half the class was sleeping, and the TFs were overly obsessed with making sure no one had any screens out (this includes iPads to take notes). Daniel Carpenter is the perfect example of a lecturer who would benefit greatly from taking Expos40. He has absolutely no vocal variety and used filler words so often (&quot;umm&quot; is his favorite) that it is hard to even understand what he is saying.  The lecture slides were primarily quotes copy and pasted from primary readings, which was unhelpful for following along when I started zoning out (the lecturer generates extremely little enthusiasm for the course material and makes it extremely dry). the lectures are all facts and no analysis, which makes it ironic when they want us to write critical essays. Much to my disappointment, I still do not understand what a republic is, and I am even less curious about what it is after this semester.</td>

The subject matter is fascinating, but the assignments can sometimes be laborious. The collaborative paper is awful if you get paired with the wrong partners.  The fact that there are so many readings assigned in a gened means that most people tend not to read them (except the few interested gov people), which can make section hit&#x2F;miss depending on whether people actually read. Professor Carpenter is a decent lecturer who raises all sorts of interesting points. So, please take if you are interested, but be aware that it will be by far your hardest gened (this is coming from someone who has already completed the other three).</td>

And this was my 4th gened so I feel qualified to say that lol. The papers are quite hard to do without keeping up with the readings consistently.

Also, there were additional requirements added throughout the course that were not originally in the syllabus, such as a 500 word memo due before section each week synthesizing the reading materials. There are also quizzes every lecture to track attendance, and no excused absences (not one) without a doctor&#x27;s note or note from your Resident Dean. <br/><br/>Most importantly, I would not recommend taking this course if you have any accommodations that utilize technology. This course has a no&ndash;technology policy that the teaching team takes very seriously (to the extent they have laser points to flag people using technology and will crawl over an entire row of students during lecture to ask someone to put tech away). There is no way for them to know which students have accommodations and which students don&#x27;t, so this results in students with accommodations being told to put away their assistive technology (usually after lecture has started and not at all discreet). Students with accommodations either then have to a. not use them or b. explain to the TF in front of their peers that they have accommodations. This was an issue from the start of the policy to the very last day of class, despite the fact that teaching team wasn&#x27;t that large. <br/><br/>All in all &ndash; there are probably better ways to fulfill this gened requirement.</td>

Unfortunately, the attendance policy was irritating: required attendance, of course, but there would be random attendance checks on only some days, which meant that if you weren&#x27;t in class and they happened to send out an attendance poll, then you were kind of screwed, especially since there were only about 7 in total. Also, we weren&#x27;t allowed to use electronics in class, which I understand from the prof&#x27;s perspective in forcing us to really lock in during class, but it was just frustrating how much of a stickler the prof and teaching team were about it: during class in the massive art museum lecture hall, all the TFs would stand scattered about the room to watch hawkishly for anyone pulling out a phone or computer... felt extremely unnecessary and extra in my opinion. Also, the weekly readings were insane: by each class period, we were expected to have read over 100&ndash;150 pages which is maybe okay if this were an actual philosophy or history course, but for a gened, that feels slightly overwhelming and certainly discouraged me from wanting to finish them.</td>

The professor is pretty dry in the lectures despite what some people may have said in previous q guides, the lectures were in a dimly lit room, the prof&#x27;s is fairly slow and rambling, the content is dry, directionless, and lacks narrative. And worse of all, not only are computers not allowed, there is active hunting of any electronics usage at all, including quick peeks on phone, at the direction of the professor. The reading list is overwhelmingly long, so don&#x27;t bother reading them, you can probably get away with doing 2&ndash;3 hours of work, sit through 3 hours of classes. Oh and also participation is 40&ndash;60% of your grade? And then there are also random quizzes that count toward participation half the lectures meaning you have to try to pay attention and not sleep, and you can&#x27;t miss lectures (of course they are helicopter checking if people send details to people not in class). And the material covers mostly like European republics 200&ndash;300 years ago, and the Constitution gets around 3 lectures, so the content is not particularly redeeming. I don&#x27;t like to bash courses, but this one just takes a wrong turn at every stop and is irredeemable. And the prof explains that he&#x27;s involved with whatever committee that is deciding device usage policies and is pushing for every class to ban all devices.. I don&#x27;t know if their goal is to scare students away from taking the course, but if it is, they&#x27;re succeeding.</td>

Prof. Carpenter definitely knows his stuff, and it was refreshing to be in a GenEd&#x2F;Gov class where  the presentation of the material felt legitimately rigorous. The overarching thesis of the course was at times hard to follow, though, and there were too many readings to actually legitimately engage with any of them. Seems like expectations&#x2F;grading across sections varied a lot.<br/><br/>My 2 biggest complaints: the second partner essay will actually drive you insane if you get randomly paired with the wrong person.
