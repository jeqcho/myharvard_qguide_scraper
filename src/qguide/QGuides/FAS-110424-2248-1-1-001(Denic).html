Most topics we learnt about were random and I walk out of the classroom without a concrete overview of molecular and cellular biology as was promised. We ended up focusing on niche mcb topics that were loosely connected.<br/><br/>Emma is an amazing lecturer and I wish she taught the course alone or with Dom. The exams are hard so be prepared to suffer.  Good luck, you&#x27;ll learn a lot and you&#x27;ll grow as a learner and scientist!</td>

As long as you keep up with the course, studying for the exams should not take too much time; they are based on problem solving rather than memorization, so all the psets, section handouts, and quizzes should prepare you well. The 4 hour section and lab time seems super long, but we often got out early and I had fun with my lab group.</td>

			<td class="TabularBody_LeftColumn" headers="comment-2_b89dd7a0-8433-4cb3-9273-58b0770b964c">PLEASE DON&#x27;T TAKE THIS CLASS UNLESS YOU HAVE TO!!! There are a lot of things to say about this class, and this is coming from someone who actually did well in the class:<br/><br/>1) It is a very difficult class, and it is not an elective to just take for funsies. If you have to take this class, I am sorry, but it is doable. If you don&#x27;t have to take this class, then don&#x27;t even question it, don&#x27;t take it.<br/><br/>2) The reason the class is so difficult is because it is structured so differently than most likely any class you have taken at Harvard. You have to learn all of the content outside of class from short lecture videos, and then take weekly reading quizzes (which are highkey just busy work), and during class time, you have open discussions with professors and your peers about the lecture videos. That being said, you have to watch the lecture videos in order to understand the course content. There is literally NO way around not watching them because I honestly don&#x27;t think I learned anything in class.<br/><br/>3) LAB IS SO SO SO IMPORTANT!!!!! They are super strict about attendance for the combined lab&#x2F;section time, and it is for a reason. It is so important to actually pay attention during the section because the questions are worded similarly to PSETs and the exams. Also, the majority of your grade is a lab (exams are only 30%, and no final). So you actually need to participate and put in so much effort to your lab work. Tbh lab is not that difficult, so as long as you put in effort, get that easy A for your lab grade.<br/><br/>4) DO NOT FALL BEHIND! This course seems like there is not a lot of work. You have lecture videos and a reading quiz each week (about 1 hour), then one PSET a week (2&ndash;3 hours), and then lab assignments (2 hours but can be completed during lab time)! So even though there really is only three assignments a week, the PSETs are due every Friday night, and they are very lengthy, you write about a paragraph response for each question. MAKE SURE TO DO HOMEWORK!!! Because this course is very hands&ndash;on and discussion&ndash;based, the lectures don&#x27;t really have a lot of the content to know for the exams, but the PSETs will be your study guides!!<br/><br/>Honestly, this course is difficult, and it is not to be taken by someone who is not up for the challenge, so don&#x27;t take it unless you have to, but I took it at the same time as Chem17, and I am still standing, which means so can you!! :)</td>

			<td class="TabularBody_LeftColumn" headers="comment-2_b89dd7a0-8433-4cb3-9273-58b0770b964c">BOTTOM LINE: one of the coolest courses i’ve taken so far, but if you don’t explicitly need MCB60 for a requirement (ex: another course will work premeds) don’t take MCB60.  <br/><br/><br/>MCB60 requires a lot of time commitment, it’s a difficult course introducing a lot of biological mechanisms at a decent depth. The flipped classroom&ndash;ish model uses videos that are a bit dated and expects that students have a strong understanding the concepts presented to them in the video before showing up to live lecture that week. Live lecture will spend time answering questions of increasing manipulation of the original system and not much time covering the basic system presented in the video. TA watch parties are incredibly helpful, and my number one advice for all classes is to disregard what your peers may&#x2F;may not think of you. Who cares if someone thinks you’re a dunce, if you can get all your questions and confusions ironed out(even stupid questions) thus subsequently nailing the exams, you’re the winner in the end. Wording on some of the PSET gradings can be slightly picky so I suggest checking in on office hours — this can also help clear any misconceptions. ASK ABOUT THE FORMATTING OF ACCEPTABLE EXAM ANSWERS.<br/><br/>Finally, a semi&ndash;known secret is that all course staff (TAs, lectures, some CAs) are enthusiastic and willing to put in extra time to work with you one&ndash;on&ndash;one if your availability falls outside of OH. Go to OH to discuss the lectures if you need to&#x2F;set up additional OH to re&ndash;discuss concepts covered in lecture videos and live lecture.</td>

The material was engaging, and I appreciate that the course doesn&#x27;t emphasize memorization. You should note that the course uses a flipped classroom, so you&#x27;ll be watching videos ahead of class time. This isn&#x27;t necessarily bad or good, just different than typical stem classes. Also, there were three lecturers (Dominic, Vlad and Emma), and I don&#x27;t think that instruction quality was constant throughout the course. Section was great &ndash; very helpful in summarizing key concepts which can sometimes get lost because of the exploratory nature of the class. And I know the lab sounds long but we typically got out early and it was the most painless (and actually interesting) lab I&#x27;ve had over my four years at Harvard. Overall, I&#x27;m sure there are easier biology classes out there, but I found this one to be relatively interesting.</td>

Although the exams are hard, the teaching staff support is incredible, and you can significantly improve as a result of this class as a scientific thinker. Take advantage of office hours and your peers for completing the Psets and preparing for the test; discussion with others is really helpful in deepening your understanding and exposing any misconceptions.

Last spring (and even in the beginning of the semester), everyone told me not to take this course (mostly people who haven&#x27;t taken it themselves) because of its reputation of being difficult. Although I ended up declaring Neuro (and got a lot of comments about still being in MCB 60 :(), I&#x27;m SO beyond grateful I stuck with it. MCB 60 is one of the best courses I&#x27;ve taken so far. The content is VERY interesting. The course is pretty challenging, but I&#x27;m leaving with so much knowledge and so many new skills. I learned SO much, and the course experience has been great, thanks to the amazing instructors, TFs, and CAs (whose office hours I went to every week). The MCB 60 community is awesome. Although lab is 4 hrs, make the most out of it by building a community. The experimental design module was very difficult, and my group had to come in for a full 9 hour day outside of our assigned lab time to repeat an experiment. It was frustrating at the time, but it paid off because the teaching staff really saw our dedication and efforts. Emma is the course CPM and one of the course instructors. She is AMAZING &ndash;&ndash; very very kind and helpful! Everyone in the course is so willing to help. The psets aren&#x27;t too long, but they can be a little difficult because it&#x27;s a new way of thinking for most. Therefore, I highly recommend going to office hours. There are so many resources, make sure to make use of them! And please, if you have the slightest interest in the course material, TAKE IT! I HIGHLY recommend. SO glad I made the decision to continue with it. I truly think this course will transform how you approach science.</td>

Yes, I think the course is hard and the exams are difficult (they have tricky questions and are time&ndash;pressured, rather than based on knowledge alone). However, the material is very interesting, the weekly workload is manageable (they start off the course saying psets should take &lt;4 hours per week), and the format of the course is awesome. Lecture consists of a bunch of questions we work through together, and the course is well&ndash;staffed, meaning that it often feels like you get a super personal experience. Lab is also very practical, and you learn a number of basic but important bio lab skills &ndash; including getting to design your own experiment. I also liked that the lecturers would change every few weeks, which kept things fresh. Overall, an awesome class that I would recommend to anyone interested in bio, whether a concentrator or not.</td>

Like I genuinely failed an exam, but for some reason I think I left this class with a positive experience? Sometimes it feels like nothing makes sense, but when it does make sense it feels really good. You really have to stay on top of everything because the content just keeps coming and its lowkey all unrelated so its easy to lose pieces here and there and never even realize you missed something. So yeah this class is really hard and you probably shouldn&#x27;t take it unless you have to, but if you DO have to don&#x27;t be too scared because I think it was actually really rewarding.</td>

The PSETs were genuinely fun and I thought the entire course was structured quite well. That&#x27;s not to say I did not struggle — I studied a lot and still did bad on one of the tests. But I picked up the pieces and so can you. Don&#x27;t let anything discourage you; you belong in this class just as much as anyone else, and you will learn and do awesome things. You even get to design and carry out your own multi&ndash;week lab project! Needless to say, this class is SO incredible and I highly recommend it. Don&#x27;t let what you hear scare you :)</td>

This class is not easy in my opinion, and you do need to put in the effort for it; if you are looking for some gateway biology class for some reason, people will recommend you take Neuro 80 or another class and not MCB 60. I agree.<br/><br/>If you do take this class, however, remember to trust nothing but the data (this applies much in the assessments). Beware of Vlad&#x27;s lectures, they are quite horrendous and I think I would not have survived without the wonderful TF and CA team. They are amazing. The class in general is definitely a ride, but you will come out stronger and more prepared for research.<br/><br/>Tldr, there are many things in the world that present you with vague, not&ndash;always&ndash;so&ndash;convincing answers and makes you question what you are actually doing.

It was genuinely so horrible to have to take the midterms on the same day at the end of the semester, and having the midterms essentially back to back with Chem17. Labs were also really long (like five hours essentially), and I think the design&ndash;your&ndash;own experiment aspect of the course was unnecessary and somewhat of a waste of time. It&#x27;s a tough course, you&#x27;ll trauma bond with your peers, and then you&#x27;ll end up liking it a bit more at the end because of Stockholm Syndrome. Watch parties are super helpful and CAs honestly carried me through the course with their office hours and watch parties — genuinely so appreciative for them and the work they put in. Their review sessions were also helpful before each midterm. The course is hard, it will be a battle, and it might be part of what makes sophomore fall so horrible and miserable. If you don&#x27;t have to take it, then don&#x27;t take it and go take Neuro80 instead. At least there&#x27;s no final though.</td>

			<td class="TabularBody_LeftColumn" headers="comment-2_b89dd7a0-8433-4cb3-9273-58b0770b964c">Lecture material:<br/>The strength of this course is the amount of incredibly interesting material that we learn. Every day in class and outside of class is a day of learning. I am usually not a fan of flip classroom styled classes, but this course has changed my mind. We have recorded materials that we need to watch before lectures, and they form the foundation for our discussion in our class. I think the pace of the class is food because every week, we move onto a different topic. Sometimes, they may be related but not always. I think having time during the weekend to watch the recorded videos is a perfect opportunity for me to pace myself of the foundation I need. If I learned the foundation in lecture, I would be so lost because of the amount of material covered in an hour. I am a bit slow, so it takes me about 2&ndash;3 hours to get through the weekly videos. The discussions in class are really helpful because we dissect experimental results, which helps us when we complete the psets and just think like a scientist. This class would NOT work if we learned the material in class and conducted a discussion in class. There would simply not be enough time. We learn so much during discussions, and it is really important that the slides are more clearly noted with what we have learned. At the beginning of the class, the course staff was like ‘oh, we cover a lot, sometime if you take notes than it will distract you and make you miss important details’ and I was like ok, that means post discussion slides would be detailed with notes, and that only proves to be true for some and not all of the discussion materials. <br/><br/>Course staff:<br/>We have three different lecturers, Dominic, Vlad, and Emma. Each three of the lecturers vary differently in their discussion style. It&#x27;s like getting whiplash every 3&ndash;4 weeks. Out of the three, my favorite are Dominic and Emma. Dominic is good at fostering discussion ground. Emma is the most clear to the point. Vlad is very verbose, beats around the bush half the time, slides are not clearly labeled. I had a great and knowledgable TF that made section less painless. All of the CAs have taken the class before, and they have a superb understanding of the course material and the stress that goes along with this class.<br/><br/>Section:<br/>The section is 4 hours long because it includes going over lecture material and lab. I really enjoyed the lab components. It is indeed about 3&ndash;4 hours a week, but I had a great randomly assigned lab group and a wonderful TF. <br/><br/>Psets:<br/>The psets are not that much of a time commitment. If you go to the right CA office hours, you can get all of it done within the single hour and then have some spare time on your own to polish the answers you submit. They highly revolve around experimental data, which I think is great for fostering critical thinking.<br/><br/>Exams:<br/>I wish the exams covered also conceptual questions and basic knowledge rather than just dissecting experimental results. Dissecting the amount of experimental results that we do in an hour and 15 minutes of exam time is sometimes unreasonable and not practical. In the real world, you would have lot more time to come up with the conclusions that we were to ask to come up with in the exam room. <br/><br/>Background:<br/>I am not an MCB concentrator. I have never taken ls1a and ls1b before. I did relatively fine in the class. I would say in the pond full of premeds that this class is, the class was a bit more stressful due to the students than the professors. Students seem to always be a bit competitive, and it might just be me, but a bit judgmental. I get some off&ndash;putting looks when I say something weird or incorrect in OH or in section, but I feel like that is what OH and section is for. Section TF and OH CAs are generally very good at slowing down the pace to help with understanding. It’s just that people who have a good on hold on the content are much louder than the people who are confused. People in the class are generally pretty cracked, but as an individual, I still need to iron out the confusion I have. There are numerous times where I were made to feel inferior, but I think that is the nature of a biology class, and you can’t take a biology class like this without having this many premeds in it. But don’t let this be your deciding factor of whether you take this class or not. I really enjoyed the class regardless of how I felt about the students.</td>

Don&#x27;t get intimidated by the readings, they are mostly for necessary background info if you find yourself really lost on a concept, though you will have to skim a little bit to do the quizzes.

With attention to detail on problem sets and a good lab group, your grade in the class will most likely turn out better than you expect. The course staff is incredible, especially Emma and Dominic (go to their office hours!) Beware of Vlad&#x27;s lectures&ndash;they are definitely confusing and cause Exam 2 to have the lowest averages. The lab is also annoying since it is 4.25 hours, but my lab often got out early and the assays and experiments were very cool as they followed what we were learning in class. There is also no final exam! (but beware if you are taking this with Chem 17&ndash;the exam schedules will be almost identical).

At one point in time I did too. I now realize that some classes simply aren&#x27;t designed for you to succeed and do not offer much chance for redemption. Quite frankly, this course is meant to weed some people out. If you are one of those people, I pray that you have a good support system. Here&#x27;s my breakdown:<br/>Lecture:<br/>Fairly bland. Broken down into 3 sections where each instructor takes a section throughout a third of the semester each. Q&amp;A is boring and often uninformative if you&#x27;ve already read the textbook. If you don&#x27;t sit next to course staff, then you&#x27;re practically just sitting there and waiting for the sessions to end. Although, if you&#x27;re lost in lecture and can&#x27;t immediately ask a nearby facilitator, then you&#x27;re completely cooked.<br/>PSETs&#x2F;Lab&#x2F;Section&#x2F;Participation:<br/>For most components of the course, grading is very light. Some might even say too light. The section work is fairly easy and at office hours they literally read the answers aloud for the entire PSET. This will not be your struggle if you put time into it.<br/>Exams:<br/>This is where the course crumbles. The course staff knows it too. Anyone who has taken this course will tell you that this is where things go downhill. There are only 3 exams total. They will try to tell you that each ONLY accounts for 10% of your grade and then bat their eyes hoping to convince you that they care about your mental health. However, the averages for each exam are much lower than previous classes you are used to. Get used to hearing scores of 50&ndash;70%. So that 10% means that you might have just lost 5% of your total course grade from one exam. Need an A? Well if you mess up on the first exam then you are done for. Say goodbye to those hopes and dreams. Needless to say, this happened to me. I tried to ask a few members of course staff for help, and I received some truly enlightening advice: that I should study more. I was devastated and nobody offered me any glimpse at coming back after the first exam. Thanks a lot, MCB 60 course staff. It was a pleasure.<br/>If you&#x27;re still reading this, I hope this works out better for you! I realize that you&#x27;ll probably take it anyways.<br/>I can confidently say that taking this course obliterated my confidence in cell bio, which was a subject that I had a genuine interest in. Might have to switch concentrations too. Yay me :)</td>

The teaching staff outside of the main 3 lecturers can be kind of finicky, and if you get the vibe that your TF is not the most qualified, LISTEN TO THAT VOICE AND SWITCH OUT OF THAT SECTION</td>

Some recommendations I&#x27;ve heard people give are to: take the practice exam without your study sheet so you know what you need to pull your notes up for, go to the lecture video viewings (I never did this, but it can be good), redo the section worksheets&#x2F;homework, and look at the key concepts&#x2F;objectives&#x2F;questions outlined in each lecture and make sure you can describe&#x2F;know how to answer them. The psets are a good way to test your understanding, and there are a lot of office hours which is great!

Absolutely go to office hours to do your Psets and review for the exams.  CAs and TFs are your lifelines. Exams are difficult but fair if you really study the Psets, lecture breakout questions, and section handouts.  In my experience, the gauge for how well I was doing was dependent on how well I understood the pathways and lay them out in logical explanations. Please don&#x27;t go into the exams without being able to explain the pathways!! Finally, the textbook readings are vastly irrelevant, don&#x27;t spend too much time on them.

The content was very interesting and engaging, and I feel that you get a little bit of everything (which can guide you in what you want to take in future semesters). Section was definitely weird but still enjoyable. 4 hours are obviously daunting, but the time really does fly by; section was immensely helpful for understanding course content, and the lab component actually felt rewarding and engaging. As an added bonus, there is no final exam, instead replaced by two final projects (one where you design an experiment and one where you present a paper).<br/><br/>From here, though, things get a little dicey. I think the three professors are all very cool. However, their teaching styles are incredibly different. You&#x27;ll definitely find yourselves gravitating towards one, but just brace yourself for these abrupt changes. In addition, office hours were inconsistent.

I think if you have this possibility you shouldn&#x27;t be scared of taking MCB60 later on (it really depends on what you are most interested in, if you are interested in taking advanced classes if bio earlier on in college I would leave Orgo for later, if you want to take advanced chem classes earlier I would do MCB60 later). Overall, I think just try to work with the platforms that the class provides you to succeed. I went to the watch parties on saturdays, finished the videos quite fast and made sure my quizes had the right a answers. I attempted the psets and then went to OH and finished it in a few weeks. The absolute hardest part of this class is THE LAB. I can say that when we were doing the experimental part of the lab I stayed 1&ndash;2h every week after the scheduled time for lab.

Mao’s lectures are succinct, Vlad’s are harsh because he assumes his students have the same biology background he does, and Emma seems to be the lecturer with the most 1:1 experience with students because her lectures are amazing. Ask questions early and go through all available material before midterms; the exams have a very tough time limit and partial credit is very difficult to predict. Thank god there’s no final.  Admin always schedules MCB60 and CHEM17 exams on the same week, which makes everything needlessly more complicated. Labs are time intensive, but you’ll get some independent lab experience out of them unlike LS1A&#x2F;LS1B.
