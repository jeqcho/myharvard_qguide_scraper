Daniel Gilbert makes every lecture feel like going to a TED talk. I was basically never distracted and went to&#x2F;watched every single lecture. He&#x27;s a truly gifted speaker.<br/><br/>The course content is actually really interesting. I signed up for Chapter Zero which was also a pretty positive experience. It&#x27;s low work and nice to have extra credit, though you probably won&#x27;t need it. Studying for the exams literally requires just taking notes on the content from lectures&#x2F;lecture slides and going through each of the chapter review&#x27;s for each chapter. I left studying for each exam up until ~3 days before each exam and probably spent 15 hours studying for each, the number will really depend on how many of the lectures&#x2F;chapters of the textbook you leave towards the end which for me tended to be a lot. The exam really aren&#x27;t so bad and this course isn&#x27;t exactly being taken by the most competitive students at Harvard, so anyone putting in effort should probably be fine. I highly recommend this course.</td>

Although this class does not have any psets or assignments, I would definitely TAKE NOTES for the textbook. The course only has two midterms which determine your entire grade, but these tests are not too bad as long as you stay on top of the readings. Also, definitely join the Chapter 0 book club! It is an easy way to boost your grade, and it is pretty fun!</td>

So getting an A shouldnt be too hard, you just need to put the work in going to every lecture, and doing all the readings (readings are NOT trivial). i took it pass&#x2F;fail after i realized the content just wasnt worth putting that time into. also, there is no study material for the exams other than the lectures and readings (no practice questions, and no psets to begin with)</td>

While the time commitment and two exams seem scary, I promise that it is fully worth taking the class. Professor Gilbert is a great lecturer and made each class entertaining and fully engaging. Make sure to get into Chapter Zero Book Club, it is the best way to help boost your grade since you have no PSETS or graded work beyond tests. Chapter Zero is VERY interesting and not to demanding. READ THE TEXTBOOK, you can do well in the class if you read this and don&#x27;t fall behind— if you fall behind it well become significantly harder amongst work for other classes. This class is manageable and a great intro to psychology.</td>

Prof. Gilbert is awesome and made me genuinely look forward to going to lecture. Even the very long textbook readings (which I read even though many did not) are interesting.

			<td class="TabularBody_LeftColumn" headers="comment-2_3f29eafa-4649-48dc-999d-730d23b58102">I recommend Psych 1 not only to students already interested in psychology and&#x2F;or related fields, but more broadly, to anyone interested in gaining more scientific, accurate, thorough understanding of people (ergo, society and themself). Psych 1 efficiently and effectively provides an introduction to the main areas of psychology, while also giving you insight into how psychologists design experiments, test and come up with hypotheses, draw and revise conclusions, assess the believability of claims. <br/><br/>From experience in the course, I got the perception that while psychology faces difficulty with gathering accurate evidence, arriving at sound conclusions, and even just in de&ndash;abstracting ideas, the challenge lends to a process of development in the field that goes beyond the scientific method in its astounding intuitiveness and ingenuity. In true social science fashion, Psych 1 felt similar to philosophy in that the ideas are packed with moral and ethical interpretations and consequences, but also remained rooted in scientific practice and thinking with enough technical detail to stay grounded. Psychology touches upon heavy existential and humanistic topics, and Gilbert’s perspective on these topics felt simultaneously sobering and inspiring, and truthful yet optimistic. <br/><br/>The readings and lectures are both very high&ndash;quality (Gilbert is super compelling, both in the classroom and on the page), and they complement each other very well. Often, lecture is key in understanding and gaining intuition for a concept that is presented in a more abstract, definition&ndash;heavy way in the textbook. Lecture also provides a simple, memorable ways to think about ideas. On other occasions, the textbook goes into the level of detail needed to solidify one’s understanding and clear confusions. The textbook also contains a lot of content that you won’t catch during lecture, and these topics often show up in some basic way on tests.  <br/><br/>Unless you seek it out, Gilbert’s Psych 1 does not come equipped with a lot of guidance, as the class boils down to attending lectures and reading the textbook, with no other required assignments or homework. Your understanding is entirely measured by your performance on the two exams (quick statistics: on both exams, median was around 37&#x2F;50, A&ndash;zone cutoff was 35&#x2F;50). The advantage of this format is that you have tons of freedom to prepare for these tests and learn the content however you would like to, and most weeks of the course are pretty stress&ndash;free. Also, I have heard very good things about the Chapter Zero Book Club, which many have described as their favorite component of the class.</td>

(The rumors are true &ndash; two multiple choice exams (A&ndash;E) with 50 questions each make up your entire grade. It&#x27;s not quite that black and white, because everything is on a curve and the optional section gives you a boost, but basically your whole grade is determined by two exams). That said, the exams aren&#x27;t as bad as they&#x27;re hyped up to be. If you do the readings on time, take notes in lecture, and run through some flashcards before the exam, you&#x27;ll be fine! I have zero background in psych and scored well on both exams without too much stress. Definitely worth taking :)</td>

Each lecture feels like a TED talk, and it is so interesting that you don&#x27;t want the lecture to end. Gilbert has a knack for explaining complex concepts in simple language and always tries to give an example to make it as clear as possible. His manner of speech and fun presentation of the material absolutely made my day. Most importantly, this course provides so much useful knowledge that I think it is a must for everyone.<br/>There were a lot of readings, and sometimes it was exhausting, but they were interesting, engaging, and in some places even fun, so make sure you read it. (As a non&ndash;native English speaker, I was afraid that I would have a hard time reading, but the book is written in simple language, and it was very helpful in learning not only psychology but also helped to raise my English in my case.) This way you will not only be better prepared for the lecture and the exam, but you will also learn a lot of new things that were not in the lecture.<br/>The exam is difficult, but it is not impossible to pass. If you read and learn the important, biggest experiments and terms in bold and italics, and don&#x27;t skip lectures and remember the material from them, you have a good chance of passing. Plus curve actually helps a lot! I failed the midterm, but I started studying harder for the final and ended up getting an A in the final. But be sure to take book club, because it not only gives extra credit but also helps you memorize concepts better.<br/>If you have a chance, make sure you take office hours at least once. Gilbert helps you understand any questions better and is a very interesting and understanding person. <br/>I will definitely remember this course for a long time as one of the best, and I am so glad I was able to take it. It is a really valuable experience, and I am even more interested in psychology now.</td>

Professor Gilbert is absolutely amazing and very engaging. The course is really well formatted and organized. The one thing to know going into it is that lectures do not cover all the material in the textbook, and you are expected to know information from both for the two exams. This means that there is a lot of reading in the course and you cannot get by just by skimming. Also, join the Chapter Zero Bookclub, it is both interesting and an easy way to get extra credit (which is important considering the two exams make up your entire grade).</td>

Also, Professor Gilbert is SO COOL and such a great lecturer. Every class feels like a TED talk. He covers all the basics of psychology and sets you up with an immense amount of foundational knowledge.

It seems intimidating to only have two exams be worth your entire grade, but I feel the exams were pretty fair as long as you pay attention in lecture and go over the chapter reviews for each textbook chapter. And do chapter zero book club! Super fun way to get an extra bump on your grade and you get to yap about fun interesting psychology topics for an hour each week.</td>

Gilbert is such an engaging lecturer and does a great job teaching concepts through interactive exercises and videos on his slides. There&#x27;s a great balance between what you learn in class and reading the textbook on your own. The textbook tells you all you need to know and while the readings can be long, as long as you don&#x27;t wait until the last second they are easy to follow and fun to read. The exams are pretty fair and as long as you pay attention in class and do your readings and spend some time memorizing terms, you will do well.

My one criticism of this class is that the only assignments are two multiple choice exams (each worth 50% of your grade). The curve is generous, so if you&#x27;re good at standardized testing you can easily get an A, but I don&#x27;t feel they required much engagement with the content or showed strong understanding.

Professor Gilbert is a very entertaining professor and everyone should absolutely attend his lectures as they are very interesting, lecture attendance isn&#x27;t mandatory and recordings are posted right before the exam to review but you take the exams in the same lecture hall that the lectures are in and going to lectures greatly helps with remembering the material. <br/><br/>Your grade is based entirely on the 2 exams in the course that are non&ndash;cumulative, but there is an extra credit book club that would boost your grade by one step (B&ndash;&gt;B+ or B+&ndash;&gt;A&ndash;) which is a very helpful boost given how difficult the exams are and it gives great insurance that you will get a good grade in the course. The course is graded on a curve (60% get an A, 25% B, 15% everything else) and the curve, being as generous as it is, really saves your grade. The median on the first exam was ~75% and on the second it was ~70% so the curve brought a raw score of a C up to an A which is incredibly generous. On both exams, I studied a ton because I want to concentrate in psychology and wanted to do well in the course and my raw scores for both exams were 82% and 80% so my curved grade was an A. I also did the extra credit book club which is a great opportunity to get basically free extra credit and I recommend everyone to do it because the extra credit is very helpful when there are only 2 exams making up your entire grade.<br/><br/>For studying for the exams it is truly just memorization of the bolded terms in the textbook and the experiments discussed in lecture. There are a lot of terms in the textbook that you have to memorize so a good trick that I used was that I rewatched all the lectures and just highlighted all the terms that were repeated in both lecture and the textbook and just studied those which saved me a ton of time and it made me rewatch all the lectures. Overall, the course is amazing and a great time, for the exams just make sure you study hard, the curve is generous and the extra credit is very helpful. This course makes it entirely possible to get an A and although it may be more difficult in terms of what makes up your grade when compared to other intro courses it&#x27;s absolutely doable and not super difficult overall. &ndash; MN</td>

As long as you keep on top of your textbook readings and lecture content, they&#x27;re a breeze, and the Chapter Zero section component really helps with the curve. It&#x27;s also a cool place to discuss how the psych concepts we are learning in class can be applied to everyday life</td>

It is overall, just such a fascinating and enjoyable class. Cannot emphasize enough how much of an incredible lecturer Gilbert is. Each lecture felt so engaging because of his enthusiasm and how animatedly he presents. The opening of each lecture is an immediate attention grabber that has you attentive for the rest of the class. This class transformed the way I think and act, and I would recommend to anyone interested! Studying for the two exams can get a bit stressful, as each are 50% of your grade, but the curve is very generous. If you want to learn life&ndash;changing stuff, take this class P&#x2F;F too!!</td>

Oftentimes, the tests will generate a little bit of panic, but it is possible to do well without breaking your back.</td>

The exams are hard and tricky but it is curved so 60% of the class gets an A and even more if you do the section which bumps your grade</td>

Just be aware that there is no homework that is due, just a lot of textbook reading which is important that you do. Your grade is based on two exams but study study study and you will be fine! Doing the book club and getting extra credit is a nice safety net!</td>

BUT: Do not wait until the last couple days before the tests to start cramming the material. Go to each of the lectures, and do each of the readings in order, and you will do fine on each of the tests. You likely won&#x27;t even need the extra credit from the Book Club if you do this, but if it makes you feel better, then it isn&#x27;t that much of an added commitment either.</td>

Professor Gilbert is amazing and the material is so interesting and relevant in so many different ways. Even if you don’t want to  concentrate in Psych, it’s still worth taking because you’ll learn so much and be able to relate it to different disciples. The tests are not as challenging as they’re made out to be, as long as you study all of the words mentioned in the textbook, read the end of chapter reviews, and review all of the major studies that Professor Gilbert discusses in lecture.</td>

I learned an incredible amount even after previously taking neuroscience classes. If you want to do well in the course, make sure you attend all the lectures in person. Re&ndash;read the textbook before exams, 1&#x2F;2 the exam questions come from the textbook. There are only 2 midterms, no other assignments so aside for those weeks the course is very light. I&#x27;d really recommend taking this course if you are interested in neuro or psychology &ndash; and take the optional chapter zero book club, it is definitely worth it!!</td>

The curve is now much better, the readings are engaging, and Gilbert&#x27;s lectures are undoubtedly the most engaging I&#x27;ve found at Harvard.  All you have to do is keep up with the weekly readings and remember to go through them with a fine&ndash;tooth comb before the midterm and final. I did that for the midterm and scored extremely well &ndash;&ndash; didn&#x27;t for the final and scored around the mean. The class is what you put into it.</td>

It is super fun and has great discussion. The readings can be somewhat long, but you can get by reading the chapter summaries and knowing all the vocab words in each chapter. There are only 2 assessments (midterm and final) which can be stressful but with decent preparation is not so bad. Definitely take this course, even if you do not plan on concentrating in psych.</td>

Your grade is soley based on a midterm and a final, which are both out of 50. As long as you do okay in those, its an easy class that doesn&#x27;t grade attendance and also doesn&#x27;t have any assignments during the semester. The exams themselves are kind of challenging just because there are lots of trick questions in the multiple choice so its easy to understand the concept but still get a question wrong on the test. That said, if you&#x27;re confident in your ability to get above like 50% on both of the tests and plan on taking the class pass fail then it is really a no brainer. The class is also kind of interesting if you choose to engage.</td>

			<td class="TabularBody_LeftColumn" headers="comment-2_3f29eafa-4649-48dc-999d-730d23b58102">This is a great class for people who have a lot of work during the semester and want a class with two assignments—final and midterm.  If you are taking pass&ndash;fail its almost zero work—you could study for 2 hours for each exam and be fine. If you are taking for a letter grade, it&#x27;s much easier to get an A than people make it seem. Spend a week before the test studying the bold terms from the textbook (with a quizlet), and review the lecture notes and you should be fine. The curve is so strong that you can get 35&#x2F;50 on both exams and still be fine. Do the chapter zero readings if you want the extra insurance against getting a B+, but its probably better to spend the time studying. This is an awesome class that will change the way you view the world around you. I would highly recommend.</td>

As you&#x27;ll probably see everyone say, the lectures are very rehearsed and performed by Professor Gilbert, and they&#x27;re mostly fun and engaging. As you might not see as many people say, I think the textbook is also quite good at presenting the material in a clear and thoughtful way. If you are a good multiple choice test&ndash;taker and you attend lectures and study a bit before the exams, you will not have any difficulty getting an A in the course. Also whatever you do ATTEND THE CHAPTER ZERO BOOK CLUB there is literally no reason not to: it&#x27;s a free grade boost and super chill!</td>
