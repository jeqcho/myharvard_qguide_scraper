Because this is a smaller class, you get to know your classmates much better. Our community has been quite strong. This class was difficult and sometimes quite stressful, especially leading up to midterms, but this class wasn&#x27;t as difficult as I thought it would be, so please don&#x27;t let fear be a deterrent to you not taking this class. If you are willing to pay attention during lectures and review concepts you are unsure of, you will do well in the class. The class emphasizes effort and understanding over grades.</td>

You will face challenges in this class whether its in in the first week or the final week. There is a mountain of material to cover in essentially 14 weeks. It is more that just biology and chemistry with a little math and cs. Id say the best way to measure its intensity is a combination of the central concepts of AP Chemistry, Biology, Comp Sci A, Calculus BC, and Statistics, all at a higher level than AP curriculum, in 14 weeks. I have felt lost and hopeless more times in this class than I have ever felt in high school, but I have also had some of the best moments of my life with my fellow classmates. The community cultivated by the students who take LS50 is one of the strongest ones that I am a part of. We essentially go through this arduous experience together, so its sort of a bond forged in molten metal (aka very strong). I can say the only reason I have made it through this course is the resources this community, along with the teaching staff have provided, including daily OH and flexible TF OH throughout the week.<br/><br/>Let my final words be this: You will learn a lot in this course and have a lot of fun as well, but you will have to earn it.</td>

			<td class="TabularBody_LeftColumn" headers="comment-2_d2bc76fc-ab0a-45bd-935c-d31e0f8396c2">This course is quite like drinking from a firehose. You get a bit of everything in the various STEM fields. It is admittedly a neat experience to learn so many different concepts that tend to be applicable and important to understanding their respective fields. At the same time, if you aren&#x27;t necessarily interested in the concepts, it can be like trudging through mud.<br/><br/>Having come in with AP Bio, Chem, Stats, Physics, CS, and Calc as well as a strong STEM background, some of the lecture content was not new. For the content that was new, they presented reasonably hard challenges. Keep in mind that lectures are meant to be fast and comprehension of new content is expected to be done by reviewing slides on your own outside of class.<br/><br/>A great aspect of LS50 is the community. The people you chug through psets and &quot;trauma&ndash;bond&quot; with largely shape this class into what it is. Professors can be very funny in their lectures too—some more consistently than others. Overall, this class provides a great community and space for you to expand your STEM knowledge—if that is what you want (you may not realize the answer to this until you experience the class for yourself).</td>

			<td class="TabularBody_LeftColumn" headers="comment-2_d2bc76fc-ab0a-45bd-935c-d31e0f8396c2">By far, the best aspect of this course is the community. At first, you will feel intimidated because the loudest students in the course are the smartest and the ones who already understand everything being covered in the lectures. It made me feel like I was the only one who couldn&#x27;t understand anything and was feeling lost, but when you find the group of people that you can struggle with and talk to, the course feels a lot more manageable! I got so close with some people in this class and I was able to vent to them about problem sets or lectures. Additionally, the teaching staff and specifically the CAs are so sweet and are always there&#x2F;willing to support you. Office hours are SO SO helpful because there are other students struggling there, and the CAs will walk you through difficult concepts and problem set questions. Finally, the topics we cover in class are super interesting and they will make you think about science in ways that you&#x27;ve probably never thought about. They make connections between biology, chemistry, physics, and math that are mind boggling and unique, and it&#x27;s a great way to learn more about different research topics. <br/><br/>However, this class is definitely very time&ndash;consuming and you need to be prepared to dedicate time to reviewing lectures, doing problem sets, and studying for exams. This class is by no means easy and there are definitely difficult moments where you will feel like nothing is working out, so you will have to find the study strategy that works best for you and the routine that will lead you to success. Additionally, if you&#x27;re looking for an introduction to biology&#x2F;life sciences oriented class, I would not recommend this class. It was what I was expecting going into LS50, but you will come to find that the course is EXTREMELY computational and that there is a big emphasis on math, Python, and physics. If you don&#x27;t have a strong background in math and programming, it will be difficult to get used to. Additionally, the instructors cover many different topics but they don&#x27;t go very in depth with them. It seems that you are covering so much ground and yet you feel like you don&#x27;t know very much about every concept. <br/><br/>Overall, this class was certainly an experience. I would recommend taking for the community aspect and the wide breadth of topics you learn. It will be challenging and nothing will be easy about this class! However, you will be forced to reevaluate how you spend your time studying, creating a routine, and figuring out what&#x27;s best for you. I learned a lot about how to be a good student through this class, and although it was tough I think any student up for it should totally take the course.</td>

I loved how the professors&#x2F;teaching staff&#x2F;CAs were so engaging and really care about you. You can literally ask them about anything. Also, the breadth of topics covered is so vast &ndash; for example all the way from Statistical Mechanics to Classical Genetics to Probability. I don&#x27;t think I would have learned so much in any other bio class, and I really appreciate how LS50 puts bio in the scope of science. Socially, I made so many friends in this class and the learning environment &amp; people are so fun. It really is a community. If your looking for a easy, traditional,, intro to bio course, I wouldn&#x27;t choose LS50 however, that being said, when I was deciding between LS50 and LS1a, I&#x27;m so thankful that I chose LS50, and I don&#x27;t regret that choice one bit. This class is life&ndash;changing in my opinion and exposed me to so many new concepts and fields of science. They really prepare you to think critically and question your methods! Seriously, I feel like this class is so unique and engaging, I would highly recommend to take it.</td>

			<td class="TabularBody_LeftColumn" headers="comment-2_d2bc76fc-ab0a-45bd-935c-d31e0f8396c2">The common conception of this class fashions it as something akin to ritual sacrifice, an idea that does not really reflect reality in the slightest. Yes, the course is difficult. Yes, you will probably struggle at various points throughout the semester (or maybe the whole). LS50 is still the best formal learning experience I have ever had, hands down.<br/><br/>I had a lot of fears coming into the class: My science background was not at all comprehensive. I did not take AP Biology nor AP Chemistry (or their IB equivalents). I had no formal research experience. Al of my STEM education during high school revolved around physics and math.<br/><br/>As Andrew will tell you early in the class, everyone comes into Harvard with their own strengths and weaknesses. (I&#x27;m still pretty bad at chemistry.) Your ability to succeed is not at all dependent on how much time you spent in a lab during high school, so take what the website says seriously: The only formal requirements for this course are a motivation to learn and a strong background in calculus. Don&#x27;t be intimidated by the high&ndash;powered pre&ndash;meds or students with published research. They&#x27;ll definitely be at an advantage for the basics, but LS50 moves pretty quickly beyond what anyone has ever learned in high school; nobody I surveyed had ever heard of statistical mechanics before the class. (The textbook they teach stat mech out of is intended for graduate students. Give it a thorough read during the unit; it will undoubtedly clarify concepts for you.) <br/><br/>I won&#x27;t pretend that I was never challenged by the work or always felt supremely confident while trying to complete a problem set. Especially in the first few weeks of the class, I was at nearly every office hours and pestering my peers with what I&#x27;m sure were very basic questions about biology and chemistry. Thankfully, my classmates and course staff were wonderful; once I got the basic concepts drilled down, I was able to learn at the same pace as everybody else.<br/><br/>Even though the course is challenging, I never felt overwhelmed. I had time to have fun over the weekend and enjoy college without being married to the library. You&#x27;ll learn quickly that the amount of time you spend in the library at Harvard is less correlated with how well you&#x27;re doing your classes than you might think; consider that people complaining that they spend all of their time studying were probably going to do so no matter their schedule.<br/><br/>Another benefit that most students cite when taking this class is the robust community built throughout the semester. The fact that enrollment is capped at 40 students means that you&#x27;ll get to know nearly everyone in the class. Our year was especially social: You might not have the exact same experience, but I can say confidently that you will make at least a few friends during your time. We&#x27;ve had dinners, dorm room get&ndash;togethers, trips to Boston, gift exchanges, and late&ndash;night runs to the various restaurants in the square. Even though I&#x27;m not pre&ndash;med, planning to do research in the life sciences, or really that interested in biology, I&#x27;m taking LS50b in the spring largely because of the amazing people I&#x27;ve had the privilege of studying, laughing, and having (friendly) arguments with.<br/><br/>As for the course staff, they were all excellent. They all enjoy teaching the class because the students taking it are self&ndash;selecting: The proportion of students uninterested and putting in minimal effort to engage during lectures is much lower than many of the larger intro courses at Harvard.<br/><br/>As a final, but important, point: Don&#x27;t think that you won&#x27;t enjoy the class if you&#x27;re not a biology fanatic. I&#x27;m a computer nerd through and through, but had lots of fun during the class learning about the underlying physical mechanics driving our lives. This is really a class on problem&ndash;solving, and you will be better for it, no matter who you are or what you&#x27;re interested in.<br/><br/>That said, don&#x27;t take this class if it looks miserable to you. The schedule is brutal: You will be in class every morning at 10:30, not including one section and a three hour lab. That&#x27;s a big time commitment, and naturally precludes an involvement in a number of other cool classes. Remember, you&#x27;re already at Harvard: How you spend your time is up to you, so don&#x27;t continue to burden yourself with the expectation of being better than everyone else. If you don&#x27;t want to take LS50, don&#x27;t take it.<br/><br/>Some final tips:<br/>&ndash; If you&#x27;re on the fence, just lottery for the class (it gets more and more popular each year, so there&#x27;s a decent chance you won&#x27;t get in). If you change your mind, you can always turn it down. They won&#x27;t be offended.<br/>&ndash; Start your problem sets early. They&#x27;re released late Friday afternoons, but I would usually start mine on Sunday night and work on it throughout the week. It&#x27;s a lot more efficient (and less stressful) to burn the concepts into your brain over a longer period of time.<br/>&ndash; Ask lots of questions, no matter how dumb you think they are. Even Harvard professors make mistakes or say something inaccurate; if you&#x27;re confused about something, there&#x27;s a good chance there&#x27;s someone else also scratching their head.<br/>&ndash; Be social. This class would be pretty unbearable without the cool and ridiculously intelligent people you get to meet.<br/>&ndash; Stay off your laptop during lecture; get a physical notebook if you can.<br/>&ndash; Give a solid attempt at problems on the psets before going to office hours.<br/>&ndash; GET LOTS OF SLEEP. Your problems will compound if you are not getting enough rest each night.<br/>&ndash; Don&#x27;t stress about the grading. The point of this class is to learn heaps of information about modern science, which is punishing enough; the TFs are not trying to fail you.<br/><br/>Andrew states that the goal of the class is to &quot;lern stuf.&quot; I think, in this regard, we succeeded.</td>

Be prepared to do a lot of math, as there will be a ton of equations in the class than may take a couple weeks to fully understand. Go to office hours when you can, but don&#x27;t feel too guilty about missing something sometimes. Reminder also that when you get to stat mech, 99% of people will be just as confused and that is totally okay. Lastly, expect to make some really amazing, smart, and talented friends because that is what makes this course unforgettable and super worth it!</td>

It’s incredibly fast&ndash;paced, intense, and will demand 15–20 hours a week for one class. If you’re not ready to sacrifice time, risk lower grades, or handle the reality of not getting As on the midterms, this course isn’t for you. That said, if you’re willing to put in the work, LS 50 is a rewarding experience. The material is fascinating and goes super in&ndash;depth, but staying on top of the content is critical. Exams are tough, but if you show consistent effort and improvement, it’s possible to do well. The community in this class is one of its best features. You’ll bond with classmates as you trauma bond together and the professors and teaching staff are talented, supportive, and approachable. While the PSETs can be long and occasionally frustrating, going to office hours (which are held five times a week) and reviewing lecture notes will help a lot. Having some Python experience is helpful, even though the course offers a coding boot camp. Lectures are also all recorded but make sure you attend class and also review content. Don&#x27;t procrastinate, the content, PSETs, and studying will accumulate. LS 50 will challenge you and leave you exhausted, but it’s also an opportunity to grow and learn in ways few classes offer. Take it only if you’re ready to be 100% committed.</td>

Like many have said in past q&ndash;reports, LS50 feels like 60% math, 40% everything else. As a non&ndash;math person, LS50 allowed me to gain an intuition on the why behind some parts of bio (like thermodynamics, chemotaxis, and cell cycle) but it led to psets and midterms being undoubtedly challenging, despite maximizing practice resources and attending CA office hours (make sure to attend office hours, if you take LS50!!).<br/><br/>The content in this course is somewhat scattered but it was all quite fascinating as a look back on the semester; I&#x27;ll go through each of the main ideas. 1) Probability&#x2F;stats &ndash; taught by Michael well and was pretty interesting. 2) Chemistry &ndash; Emma is an amazing lecturer and will hold your attention for the entire hour and 15 minutes! 3) Lac operon &ndash; very fascinating and Andrew is a hilarious lecturer. 4) Dynamical systems &ndash; Ben is a great lecturer, but many peers and I agree this material could be removed from LS50. 4) Molecular&#x2F;classical genetics &ndash; foundational topic in molecular bio and taught by Emma&#x2F;Ben. 5) Yeast cell cycle &ndash; interesting but most relevant for the lab project with Piyush (taught by Andrew). 6) Thermodynamics&#x2F;stat mech &ndash; while, in theory, it&#x27;s interesting material and both Doeke and Michael teach well, this will suck the soul out of you at times and question your will to take LS50. 7) Eukaryotic gene expression&#x2F;dev bio &ndash; Kara is such an incredible lecturer and will make you excited to attend lecture! 8) Diffusion&#x2F;chemotaxis &ndash; kind of thrown in at the end and confusing, but still fundamentally interesting.<br/><br/>It&#x27;s important to mention that all of the instructors and CAs are warm, approachable individuals that really try hard to support you along the way, despite the material being challenging. I think everyone ends up with an A, A&ndash;, or B+ however, this course is a profound time commitment. You will get very close with your classmates in Cabot until 4 AM some nights; you will walk away from office hours feeling like you learned how to approach a problem but must return the next day; you will simultaneous question your decision to do science and embrace the beauty of the material LS50 teaches. Overall, I recommend this course if you have a strong background but you have been warned (for better and for worse). You will meet some of your greatest friends freshman year and encounter significant challenges along the way.</td>

This course touches on basically everything, from calculus to biology to physics to chemistry. It is a pretty rigorous course and meets everyday, so keep that in mind.<br/><br/>In terms of content, I felt the course is pretty math and computational based; there is a lot of probability, statistics, stat mech, in addition to biology and chemistry concepts (molecular genetics, cell cycle, etc.). It a very broad course that touches on a little bit of everything, and ties seemingly different concepts together. Overall, the lectures are truly fascinating.<br/><br/>For exams and problem sets, I felt that all the exams were pretty fair. The exams are not incredibly hard, as long as you study during the week leading up to the exam you will probably do just fine. The problem sets are very much related to the content presented in class, just try to start them early in the week so you have time to think through the more difficult problems.<br/><br/>I think that one of the most important things that you get out of this course is the friends you make (some of my closest friends I have met at Harvard so far have been from this class). In addition, the professors are amazing, and you will learn a lot. I think that sometimes the difficulty of the course is exaggerated&ndash; I feel that if you pay attention to the lectures, and go to office hours with any outlying questions you have, you will do just fine in the course. Check out the LS50 website online if you are interested in the syllabus, but if you seem vaguely interested in the course, definitely lottery to take it (there are only 40 students accepted into the course). You can always drop the course if it turns out to be too much work for you. Good luck!</td>

It is a pretty big time commitment (8 credits, 5 lectures, 3 hour lab, 1 hour section) and the material is not easy at all (95% was completely new to me), but the amount that you learn and the community are totally worth it. Very different experience from any bio course I&#x27;ve ever taken or from the standard bio curriculum. Heavy computational&#x2F;physics focus but doable even without an extensive background. The professors, TFs, and CAs are all very helpful and friendly. Take this class if you are at all interested in research: the lectures, psets, and tests are all very application based and will greatly improve your ingenuity and problem&ndash;solving skills. The lab section is also helpful in this regard since you learn lots of techniques and have the opportunity to do your own (group) experiments.<br/><br/>My background: AP Bio, Chem, Physics 1, Calc BC, CSA.  No comp bio experience, though many in this class have. Highly recommend having at least AP Bio, Chem and Calc BC (material pretty much assumes you have taken these). Also recommend having some exposure to coding, as the coding bootcamp, though helpful, is pretty fast&ndash;paced.<br/><br/>Advice if you already decided to take LS50:<br/>&ndash; Do as much of the psets on your own, most of what I learned was through the psets.<br/>&ndash; You will likely get some of your lowest test scores ever on the 3 midterms, but the final isn&#x27;t too bad. Warning for midterm 2 (stat mech)<br/>&ndash; TOUCH GRASS!!!! LS50 is very much a bubble (academically and socially) so do go outside or take a trip (could be with friends from the class) to take a break from studying every once in a while.<br/>&ndash; Embrace how much of a nerd you are for taking this course. The people here are very passionate about lots of things both within and other than biology.</td>

As soon as you start the class, go sign up for hours from ARC tutoring (if Jimena or Rae are still tutors for the class, sign up for their hours, they&#x27;re the best!). Even if you don&#x27;t need the help for the first couple of psets, you will absolutely start needing the help once the mathy concepts start kicking in. Go to as many office hours as you can and need to help clarify concepts from the professors. Go to section (I know it&#x27;s not mandatory but go anyway) because it&#x27;s very helpful to review what we learned in class. And go to as many of the CA office hours in the evenings that you can (balance this with your other classes). Ask your classmates for help too &ndash; sometimes they can explain a few things to you and you can explain a few things to them, and we can all learn from each other! Basically my point here is that you will absolutely suffer in this class, but there is no medal for suffering and not knowing what&#x27;s happening at all, so go get as many resources to help you as soon as possible.<br/><br/>2) You will suffer in this class. There is no question. I don&#x27;t know a single student in my class that did not suffer. However, you will learn so so much that you will be incredibly grateful at the end, even though it&#x27;s a very hard class. You will also trauma bond with the other people in your class through the psets and exams. By the way, you will absolutely get failing grades on your exams, and that is absolutely okay, please do not worry, you will be fine in the class. It&#x27;s about the effort, participation, and improvement you make.<br/><br/>3) This class is not for people who do not truly care about life science and are very interested in learning and spending time with the concepts. It&#x27;s also not for people who don&#x27;t want to do math, physics, or coding, and are really only interested in the bio and chem parts. <br/><br/>4) Start your psets as early as possible and try to get as much of them done before Thursday night. I know we all liked to procrastinate in high school, but if you at all value your sleep in any way, don&#x27;t leave things until Thursday night.<br/><br/>5) The professors, TFs, and CAs truly truly care about you as people. They are so so understanding in terms of extensions and you can approach them with whatever you&#x27;re concerned about in the course at all. They want to make sure that not only are you learning as a student but you are doing okay as a person. <br/><br/>Overall I would highly highly recommend this class!</td>

Yes, you will come to live and breathe LS50 without as much clout as Math 55, but the community (in my humble opinion based on interviewing Math 55 friends) is much better. <br/><br/>Objectively, LS50 does take a lot of time, but when you consider that it also counts for two classes,  the time is actually less than if you took LS1a or LPSA and a math. Also, you technically don&#x27;t need any background besides some calculus before entering, but I took the following courses and found them to provide important background: AP Bio, AP Chem, AP Calc BC, and AP Physics. Obviously, not all of these are equally important and many of my peers only had exposure to one or none and faired extremely well regardless, but as a warning. Without a high&ndash;school introduction to higher level areas within these subjects, following along during the beginning lectures will be extremely important. The lecturers tend to cover an entire year of AP content in a week or two of lectures (5&ndash;8 lectures).</td>

It&#x27;s incredibly difficult but also equally rewarding and exciting. You will tackle biological problems from the lens of other science fields (calculus, stats, physics, chemistry), which will give you an multifaceted understanding of biology. I loved that we got to see real&ndash;life application of many science concepts that we learn in high school as well as how they are all integrated. Seeing how researchers actually apply these concepts for novel research is great. The lab component is also great, as we got to do our own projects under the guidance of our lab TF. Being able to actually perform experiments and present actual novel research is a great experience for anyone looking to pursue science as a career. LS50 is where I&#x27;ve met some of my closest friends, and the community is incredibly supportive. We&#x27;ve had potlucks, fun events, late&ndash;night pset sessions, and all of the above.

My concentration advisor, Andrew Berry, told me that, &#x27;if you take LS50, it will become your life.&#x27; I was (and still am) an OEB irredentist. My background is Natural History and I crawled out of the British education system not having even done Chemistry A&ndash;Level. I scorned the idea that an introductory life sciences course could &#x27;become [my] life.&#x27; I chose LS50 as the least of three evils &ndash; (LPSA and LS1A are covered by combining the A&ndash;Level syllabus for Biology and the GCSE syllabi for Chem and Bio. I didn&#x27;t want to waste my time retreading old ground). I saw it as a stepping stone to jubilant Sophomore year when I could finally take all OEB classes and not have to think about a so&ndash;called &#x27;molecule&#x27; or &#x27;cell&#x27; for the rest of my life. I submitted the LS50 petition three hours before it was due, after two new friends I met in pre&ndash;orientation who also decided (tentatively) to take this course reminded me.<br/><br/>I will skip the fluff in the middle in a perverse subversion of in media res: taking LS50 was the best decision I had made at Harvard.<br/><br/>Professor Berry is right. LS50 absolutely *does* become your life. You will meet your LS50 classmates 5 times a week in the morning for lectures (though this number will gradually decrease as the term wears you out), once a week for sections, and once a week for lab. Because the work in LS50 is hard (every other QReport you have read so far, my dear reader, has mentioned this, so I won&#x27;t harp on about it), you will in all likelihood go to office hours and form P&ndash;Set blocks. Thus, you will meet your LS50 classmates much more than the schedule suggests. You will inevitably have lunch and dinner with them. You will inevitably find some people the company of whom you like. You will inevitably hang out with them outside of class. Come the passage of four months, and you will inevitably find yourself with a small cabal of incredible friends with whom you can share every sorrow and every joy. At least one of your friend groups will be LS50, radiating out in concentric circles from &#x27;would speak to if I am thinking of doing something I will regret&#x27; to &#x27;will take pictures of and send in the LS50 groupchat to annoy them.&#x27;<br/><br/>The LS50 course itself (content wise) is also good. By the end of the course, I found myself loving biochemistry, cellular bio, dynamical systems, and the other parts of biology that never clicked for me. Emma Nagy, the chemistry lecturer for LS50a, is amazing. She explains concepts in a way that is easy to understand and reaches to profound inter&#x2F;extrapolations which keeps you engaged in the material. I found the section explaining how the different properties of different amino acids made them behave different in proteins particularly interesting. You, of course, know this, but in the course you will learn just what properties of aminoacids contribute specifically to how they can be in a protein. If you are a chemistry person, dear viewer, you might know this further detail already and find it trite. But if so, you will probably find some other aspect of the course interesting. The course is also unintentionally funny &ndash; or maybe its us who are funny. Lock ~30 university students in a room and all make them fixate on something and they&#x27;re bound (if you know you know) to develop at least 4 group wide inside jokes after 8 hours. Show a sophmore LS50 student (one of your CAs!) a cartoon of two people wearing the exact same except one has a black right shoe while the other has a black left shoe and caption it &#x27;Enantiomers&#x27;. They will burst out laughing like S. cerevisiae ascospores emerging from the ascus, using their sharp beta&ndash;oxidation byproducts lined on the cell wall.<br/><br/>A few words on LS50&#x27;s difficulty (I WILL harp on about it. I guess you could call me a ...lyre): The first weeks start slow to ease you into a sense of security but gradually ramp up in difficulty until you reach statistical mechanics. Nearly every other QReport you have read so far will also mention that statmech is hard &ndash; which it is &ndash; but I don&#x27;t want to hyperbolize its difficulty. LS50 is an incredibly diverse course with content from statistics to developmental biology. Depending on your background, you will find different things difficult, and difficult to different degrees. I took A&ndash;Level Maths and Biology with AS&ndash;Level Statistics. For Biology, I qualified for team selection (top 16 in country) for the UK team in the International Biological Olympiad. I also know how to code somewhat competently since I learned C and Python in primary school. I am not trying to brag to you, dear reader, when I write this. I am telling you this so you rationalize *why* I found the statistics, dev. bio, genetics, and coding aspects of the course trivial, while cellular bio and biochemistry comparatively difficult. Compounding this information with the other QReports you read, I hope you will come to your own conclusions on what parts of the course you will find hard. No hurdle is insurmountable though. If you put in effort, you will be able to learn the material, even if it is after a struggle. Your perseverance will be rewarded. <br/><br/>Course support in LS50 is excellent. The CAs, TFs, and professors are all extremely kind and helpful. Take the course. Its good! However, a word of warning too. LS50 is what you make of it. You will reap what you sow, to invoke a cliche turn of phrase. You will learn little if all you do is veg in class, copy P&ndash;Set answers, or do them entirely with generative AI without even attempting it yourself. You will alienate your friends, which is one of the best things you get from LS50. Proceed into the course with prescience and kindness, which I trust you will, dear reader, if you got to THIS point of my deranged ramble.<br/><br/>TL;DR<br/>Good class, makes you good friends. Even if you think you&#x27;re an OEB guy you should take this over the other two LS courses because LS50 is more fun</td>

I learned so much, in terms of material, yes, but in things outside the coursework too, about myself and about my classmates. I really loved the class, but it did take up a very large amount of time and was very difficult. There were significant parts of almost every lecture that I didn&#x27;t understand the first time around and had to spend significant amounts of time outside of class and also apart from doing graded work, going back through the lecture slides in order to understand it better. The material was so fascinating though, and the incorporation of quantitative analysis into almost everything taught in lecture so perspective&ndash;shifting, that I was always happy to spend large amounts of time going back through lectures. If you love life science and math, and want&#x2F;are prepared to have a class potentially define your first semester of college, I cannot recommend this class highly enough.</td>

In the best way possible this course fosters a community of science loving individuals who you will get to know very well since you are seeing them every morning five days a week. That is not even including section, office hours and a three hour lab each week! This course has made me a better scientist and although it has been a wild ride (stat mech was definitely a doosy) I would not change it for the world. The teachers in this course care about you as a person, and provide knowledge on resources going on at harvard and beyond. This is not a course for the weak of heart, but believe in yourself!!</td>

If you do take this class, your experience may be different from mine or others in this q guide—for you, it might be anywhere from barely a challenge to the hardest class ever. So don&#x27;t be intimidated by LS50&#x27;s reputation or people saying that it&#x27;s incredibly difficult. In fact, if you still want to take it despite it being &quot;difficult,&quot; you definitely should! That&#x27;s probably one sign that LS50 might be for you. I have no regrets about taking this class, because of everything I&#x27;ve learned and the amazing community (peers and course staff!).</td>

Make sure your passionate, your working hard, and don&#x27;t stress yourself out too much. If you take this class you will be surrounded with the coolest people in your Freshman year class, so easy to make friends.<br/><br/>If you are deciding between LS50 and another class, choose LS50.</td>

			<td class="TabularBody_LeftColumn" headers="comment-2_d2bc76fc-ab0a-45bd-935c-d31e0f8396c2">I might be biased, but I think LS50A is genuinely the best choice I made coming to Harvard. The community is actually amazing, and it really is an environment where everyone is so down to Earth and willing to help &#x2F; support one another. The teaching staff is genuinely phenomenal, and the TFs are very supportive. I would really, really recommend it to anyone looking for a good challenge with good people; however, I did come into it with a background of AP Chem, AP Bio, AP Physics 1&#x2F;2, and AP CSA, which I think made much of the course easier than if I didn&#x27;t have the opportunity to take those classes in high school. Take this class! It is worth every second.</td>

You should 100% take this course. It is the best decision that I made. <br/><br/>The best part of LS50 is the community. Being a part of LS50 means you have 40 built&ndash;in friends. I went to parties and concerts with people in LS50. We went to support the performances of people in LS50. I celebrated Thanksgiving with LS50. You truly join a community of wonderful individuals by being a part of this class. You trauma bond over pulling all&ndash;nighters working on PSets and you are able to interact with people you normally would not have. You will also see LS50 people in all of your classes. Your class will be filled with such talented people doing all sorts of things that it is inevitable that any of the classes you take will have someone in LS50 in it. Not only are the other students great but the teaching faculty and course assistants also make this experience truly invaluable. The course assistants are upperclassmen who are truly so talented and helpful. They make an effort to get to know each and every person individually. You will be able to hear about their paths to discovering what they like which is really awesome. Also, you re taught by some of the best scientists in the world. I remember researching a topic for a research paper and one of the researchers being a faculty from LS50. it is truly amazing. They are also the sweetest people who are dedicated to making sure you learn.<br/><br/>You learn A LOT in the class. So incredibly much. Most importantly, you learn to think about biology from a mathematical perspective which is very important. That being said, it is best you come in having at least taken BC Calculus and potentially even a physics course. It will make wrapping your head around the computational aspects so much easier.<br/><br/>You learn to fail in LS50. I remember the first midterm. We got our exams back, and while I did not do the best, I was around the average. I promised myself to do much better.  I studied for the next exam two weeks in advance, pulled all&ndash;nighters, and ended up with a much worse score. I remember contemplating why I even took this course. However, I picked myself up and kept going. What is special about this course is that you are allowed to fail without worrying. You are allowed to get a bad exam score. All that matters is that you try. If the course staff and CAs see that you are putting in effort, you will get the grade you desire. if you participate eagerly in class, you will get the grade you desire. This class is an important class to take Freshman year because you can learn how to fail without the repercussions of ruining your Freshman year GPA. I much rather prefer this than taking a class like LS1A with an impossibly high cut off. The teaching staff recognizes the material they teach is difficult and compresses higher&ndash;level stem classes into a week. They just want you to try.<br/><br/>I will say the only downside of LS50 is that it is a huge time commitment. Be prepared to make best friends with Lamont or Cabot. Be prepared to spend almost all your time with your LS50 friends. Be prepared to spend hours on a PSET. It is worth it, though.</td>

If you love to learn for learning&#x27;s sake, then this is the course for you. The problem sets and exams are challenging, but, if you talk to your peers and regularly attend office hours, it comes much easier! In terms of the tests themselves, I would recommend prioritizing reviewing practice problems (which are given in abundance before tests) rather than learning every single detail of material. It is obviously helpful to have a background in Calculus BC, Chemistry, and Biology, but, in my opinion, if you are open to putting in extra work, it is not required. I had never used Python before taking this class, but the coding workshops are extremely helpful.<br/><br/>The interdisciplinary aspect is truly the best and most interesting part of the course and introduced me to biological problems and fields that I had not previously thought about or considered, but that I am now excited about potentially pursuing in the future. The lecturers, TFs, CAs are amazing and truly put in so much effort to the class and its students!<br/><br/>I highly recommend this course!! Balancing your schedule and starting PSETs and studying in advance are definitely very important, however.</td>

LS50 is a beautifully designed and challenging course that will teach you to think like a scientist and go far beyond rote memorization techniques that a lot of introductory biology courses (especially in highschool) feature.<br/><br/>The community is amazing: I wouldn’t trade it for anything. Try your best to get to know everyone in the LS50 community because it truly will elevate the experience. Now, not only are you learning about yeast (delish), statistical mechanics (yuck or yum, you pick), genetics (huzzah), and more, you’re doing all of this learning with people you genuinely love being around.<br/><br/>At the end of the day, LS50 is a challenging course but I found myself more inspired than discouraged because of how amazing the support system is. The TFs and lecturers are both outstanding: I felt very safe asking questions. If you’re interested in learning about different fields of science through a more comprehensive lens, willing to put in the work (lecture every weekday + 3 midterms!), and looking for a community of people that bring out the best in you, LS50 just might be right for you.</td>
