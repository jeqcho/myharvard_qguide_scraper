			<td class="TabularBody_LeftColumn" headers="comment-2_7be802d0-3388-4339-9169-f9afd6806a48">Synopsis:<br/>This course is an example of a toxic ex. You give all of your time, energy, love, and youthful optimism, only to get nothing back but emotional damage and a GPA that looks like a cry for help. Math 1B doesn’t test your knowledge—it tests your will to live. And I failed. Because this class isn’t just a class. It’s an experience. A curse. A shared trauma for anyone foolish enough to walk through the gates of “Integration, Series, and Differential Equations.”<br/>Every week, you are served steaming piles of content that no freshman should have to digest. Every concept, every formula, every theorem is introduced at breakneck speed and then abandoned like a broken toy. You&#x27;re told to understand series convergence tests, Taylor polynomials, differential equations, integration techniques, arc length, surface area, volumes, slope fields, Euler’s method, the logistic equation, parametric curves, polar coordinates, and three other topics I don’t even remember because I was too busy trying not to cry in Lamont.<br/>You walk into class thinking, “This will be hard, but I can handle it.” You leave every lecture with a thousand&ndash;yard stare. The TFs say things like “intuitively obvious” and “just differentiate both sides,” and you start to question not just your intelligence but your entire existence. It’s trivial how trifling this course is with how useless it is to anything that comes after. Math 21A doesn’t care what your radius of convergence was in April. No one will ever again ask you if a series converges absolutely or conditionally, but here, it’s life or death.<br/>The structure of this class is not designed to help students learn. It is designed to break them. No real examples. No real support. Just a firehose of math, and then a midterm where your only calculator is your fingers and your last three brain cells. You get PSETs with scores in the 90s and 100s and then turn around and get 59s on the exams like you’re living in an academic episode of Punk’d. You don’t know what’s real anymore.<br/>And then there’s Erica Dinkins. The Course Head. President of Pain. CEO of Suffering. She’ll look at you in office hours, explain a convergence test like you’re a PhD student, and then walk away. No follow&ndash;up. No check&ndash;in. Just a lingering air of “you should already know this.”<br/>The exam questions? Insane. They make you write 50th degree Taylor polynomials by hand. I am not exaggerating. Fifty. Terms. Handwritten. On paper. Without a calculator. You flip to the second page and it’s a nonhomogeneous second&ndash;order differential equation with variable coefficients. You flip again and it’s a Taylor series about a point that defies basic physics. You flip once more and see a convergence problem so cursed it might’ve been written in a fever dream.<br/>You try to focus, but around you, people are breaking. Someone is blinking in Morse code. A girl is whispering “p&ndash;series” under her breath like a prayer. A guy stands up, mutters “I’m done,” and walks out. You sit there, still pretending, still trying, still thinking maybe—just maybe—if you suffer enough, the math gods will reward you.<br/>They don’t.<br/>You open Gradescope, see “58% – Conduct Penalty Applied,” and all you can do is laugh. Because it’s over. Because it’s finally over. Because now you know the truth: Math 1B was never about calculus. It was about testing how much trauma you could endure before you started seeing Taylor series in your sleep.<br/>I lost a lot in this class. My confidence. My time. My sense of joy. But I gained something too: a warning. A purpose. A message to send to the next brave soul who thinks they can handle Math 1B.<br/>Don’t. Skip it. If you can. Run. Don’t walk. Take 1A. Take 21A. Take a nap. Take literally anything else. And if someone in the Math Department tells you “It’s better to go in order,” they are lying. Do not let them do to you what they did to me.<br/>Math 1B isn’t your ex because it ended. Math 1B is your ex because it left scars.<br/>✦ . 　⁺ 　 . ✦ . 　⁺ 　 . ✦<br/>The TFs weren’t just apathetic—they were prophetic. One time I asked how to evaluate the convergence of a series and the TF looked me dead in the eye and said “By the Divergence Test” like he was delivering a funeral sermon.<br/>Another time, I stayed up until 4AM trying to solve a differential equation that turned out not to have a solution. That was the moment I realized this class wasn’t about math. It was about resilience. About how long you could stare at a problem without bursting into tears.<br/>No calculator, no partial credit, no emotional support. Just vibes and integrals.<br/>You ace a PSET and feel that flicker of hope—maybe I can do this. Then the midterm hits you like a truck made of Taylor series expansions and betrayal. You go to check your grade and it says 59% “Good Effort.” You sit on your bed, motionless, eyes fixed on the wall like the first five minutes of a Netflix true crime documentary.<br/>You try to recover. You print out study guides. Watch every lecture on 2x speed. You stop seeing friends. You skip birthdays. You drop hobbies. You start sketching slope fields in the margins of your notebooks just to feel something.<br/>You reach the final exam and it’s not even a test. It’s a live&ndash;action betrayal.<br/>Octonauts. Ready for action. Because legends never die. Only their GPAs do.<br/>✦ . 　⁺ 　 . ✦ . 　⁺ 　 . ✦<br/>THE MIDTERMS: A TWO&ndash;ACT TRAGEDY<br/>MIDTERM I: THE INTEGRAL INQUISITION<br/>Two hours. Just two hours to question everything you ever thought you knew about calculus, your academic self&ndash;worth, and maybe even your childhood. It started with a deceptively gentle warm&ndash;up problem—something simple, solvable. And you think, “Okay, I can do this.” You settle in. You exhale. And then the rest of the exam hits you like a freight train filled with definite integrals and deeply personal betrayal.<br/>There were improper integrals that required more substitutions than a World Cup roster. One question involved a fraction so grotesque it looked like it had crawled out of the LaTeX version of a horror film. You spend twenty minutes trying to remember whether to use trig substitution or just lie down on the floor and accept your fate.<br/>Then there was the arc length question that ate 45 minutes of my life. I used every formula I had memorized, guessed, and even invented some that looked legitimate enough to be real. And still—no final answer. Just a page full of crossed&ndash;out regret.<br/>I remember the moment the room shifted. A collective silence settled in. Pens slowed. People looked up, dazed. I saw one girl start to cry. Another guy whispered “oh my God” and stared at his paper like it had betrayed him. The TF proctor just stood there, motionless, watching the unraveling like it was a wildlife documentary.<br/>When I handed it in, I caught the eye of someone across the room. We didn’t speak. We just nodded. It was the kind of nod soldiers give each other after surviving a battle.<br/>MIDTERM II: THE SERIES SLAUGHTER<br/>I had prepped for this one. I watched lecture replays at 1.75x speed until my brain buzzed. I built a deck of convergence test flashcards. I went to every review session. I prayed. And yet...<br/>That exam. That godforsaken exam.<br/>The first problem was deceptively short—just a series and the instruction to “Determine convergence.” Easy, right? Wrong. It was a triple&ndash;agent series. Alternating, conditionally convergent, disguised as a p&ndash;series, wrapped in logarithmic mystery. You could’ve handed it to a math PhD and they’d still hesitate.<br/>Then came the multi&ndash;part monster. A Frankenstein of nested series and approximation intervals. One part asked for the nth term. The next asked for the error bound. The next—get this—asked for a Taylor expansion of an already approximated expansion. That’s when I knew we were in the endgame.<br/>And then—yes, then—the 50th&ndash;degree Taylor polynomial.<br/>Hand. Written. With. No. Calculator.<br/>Do you understand what 50 terms of a Taylor polynomial looks like? It looks like the last thing you see before death. It looks like a punishment invented during the Spanish Inquisition. By term 12, I was laughing. By term 20, I was crying. By term 30, I had transcended time. My pencil moved, but my soul was elsewhere.<br/>The final moments were cinematic. Someone dropped their pencil and just stared at it. Another person put their head down and didn’t move. I looked over and saw someone write “f(x) ≈ please let me pass” and I knew then—we were all done.<br/>I walked out not because I was finished, but because the war had ended and I had lost. I saw a classmate outside the exam hall just pacing, whispering to himself, “I don’t even know what a series is anymore.”<br/>I went back to my room and lay flat on the floor in silence. My roommate came in and thought I was unconscious. I told him, “No, just defeated.”<br/>Grades came two weeks later. 61%. Better than Midterm I. Worse than dignity.<br/>“Reflect. Learn. Improve.” That’s what the feedback said. As if what I’d just experienced was a group project that needed tweaking. No. What I needed was an exorcism.<br/>These were not assessments. They were acts of academic violence.<br/>Stay tuned. Because the Final Exam is not a test. It is an execution.<br/>✦ . 　⁺ 　 . ✦ . 　⁺ 　 . ✦<br/>Harsh Exam Grading:<br/>MIDTERM GRADING: THE ART OF BEING JUDGED BY A VOID<br/>Every error—every single one—was penalized. Repeatedly. If you made the same mistake across parts (a), (b), and (c), you didn’t lose points once—you lost points thrice. The TFs graded like they were charging interest. One missed negative sign? Minus 2. You do it again in the next part? Minus 2 again. By the end, you weren’t just wrong. You were in mathematical debt.<br/>One student asked during office hours if points could be recovered for consistency in error. The TF responded, “This isn’t a personality test.”<br/>You start to think maybe you’re being haunted by your earlier mistakes. You see the same comment show up four times. “Wrong bounds.” “Wrong bounds again.” “Still wrong bounds.” “Really?”<br/>At this point, it’s not grading. It’s punishment layered with sarcasm. Each red mark a scar. Each deduction a reminder that math is not merciful. It remembers. And it deducts accordingly.<br/>You turn in Midterm I with a trembling hand, praying for a shred of mercy. You checked your bounds. You showed your work. You even boxed your final answers like the TF said. But the paper comes back looking like it was marked by a sleep&ndash;deprived poet with a vendetta against optimism.<br/>“Your method is novel, though not correct.” — minus 6<br/>“This integral doesn’t converge. Much like your hope.” — minus 8<br/>“Your bounds are... interpretive?” — minus 4<br/>“This is not the unit circle’s fault.” — minus 5<br/>One student wrote “I used WolframAlpha” in pencil next to a graph. It got crossed out with, “So did I. Still wrong.”<br/>Midterm II was worse. Not just because of the math, but because you genuinely thought you were improving. You walked in with notes. You’d made your own convergence cheat sheet. You believed in yourself.<br/>The TF did not.<br/>“You seem to be confusing conditional convergence with emotional instability.” — minus 6<br/>“I am unsure what this sentence is trying to prove, mathematically or spiritually.” — minus 7<br/>“This looks like a Taylor series. It is not.” — minus 10<br/>“You forgot factorials. The factorials did not forget you.” — minus 12<br/>Someone else wrote a haiku instead of solving the 50&ndash;term expansion:<br/>Infinity looms<br/>The terms grow ever longer<br/>Why are we still here?<br/>They received no points, but the TF underlined it and added: “This spoke to me.”<br/>Midterms weren’t assessments. They were confessions. And you were guilty.<br/>THE GRADING: A PSYCHOLOGICAL EXPERIMENT IN ABSURDITY<br/>When the final grades were released, you already knew it was over. But what you didn’t expect were the comments. The point deductions. The creative, soul&ndash;crushing notes left on your work like rejection letters from math itself.<br/>Here is a non&ndash;exhaustive list of actual phrases allegedly scrawled in red ink across student papers, accompanied by their corresponding point deductions:<br/>“This is not how cosine behaves.” — minus 5<br/>“You’ve summoned something dark here.” — minus 3<br/>“Technically not wrong, but also not right in any meaningful way.” — minus 7<br/>“Why is there a pirate metaphor in your radius of convergence explanation?” — minus 10<br/>“Are you okay?” — minus 2 (emotional concern but still penalized)<br/>“Octonauts ready for action.” — minus 40 (conduct penalty)<br/>“I’ve never seen someone integrate backwards before.” — minus 8<br/>“Creative, but cursed.” — minus 6<br/>“I’m giving partial credit out of pity.” — plus 2<br/>“No calculator does not mean write down vibes.” — minus 12<br/>One student included a small doodle of a slope field crying. It earned no points. Another wrote, “Please curve,” and it was underlined with a single word: “No.”<br/>You scroll through your exam. You see 58%, and next to it, a single note: “Good effort.” That’s it. Not “nice try.” Not “see me after class.” Just “good effort,” like you tried to bake cookies and burned down the kitchen.<br/>This isn’t grading. This is performance art.<br/>✦ . 　⁺ 　 . ✦ . 　⁺ 　 . ✦<br/>The 12&ndash;14 weeks of pain:<br/>WEEK 1: The Flirtation.<br/>You&#x27;re doing substitution problems like it&#x27;s a first date. Easy. Fun. You&#x27;re smiling. You&#x27;re posting your 10&#x2F;10 PSET scores like they&#x27;re thirst traps. You tell your friends, “I actually like this class.” You are innocent. You are foolish. You are doomed.<br/>WEEK 2: The Gaslight.<br/>The integrals start getting long. But not terrifying. Just enough to make you squint. Erica starts tossing out notation you haven’t seen before. A little mysterious. A little spicy. “Just remember your u&ndash;substitutions,” she says. You do. You try. You fail. But you think maybe it’s your fault. It always starts like this.<br/>WEEK 3: The Silent Treatment.<br/>You start asking questions in section. They don’t get answered. The TF writes something incomprehensible on the board and walks away. You&#x27;re told “just review your notes.” But the notes are cryptic, half&ndash;written spells. You start to realize no one&#x27;s coming to save you.<br/>WEEK 4: The Lovebomb and Withdrawal.<br/>You&#x27;re handed a worksheet with 20 problems due the next day. You complete it. You get it right. You feel proud. You think maybe things are looking up. Then, next class, Erica pulls a full 180: infinite series. 10 new tests. No warning. No transition. Just pain.<br/>WEEK 5: The Gas Explosion.<br/>Ratio test. Root test. Alternating series. Absolute convergence. Conditional convergence. Everything converges—except your understanding. You try to memorize all the tests. They start blurring together. You make a chart. The chart lies to you.<br/>WEEK 6: The Breakdown.<br/>Your PSET takes 13 hours. You cry during office hours. You email your TF and get a reply that says “Try the Comparison Test.” You eat lunch while watching a Taylor Series video at 2x speed. You forget how food tastes.<br/>WEEK 7: The Taylor Spiral.<br/>You’re asked to write a Taylor polynomial about a point that doesn&#x27;t even exist in the real world. You’re finding derivatives of transcendental functions using formulas you’ve never seen. “Just generalize,” says Erica. You generalize your sorrow.<br/>WEEK 8: The Identity Crisis.<br/>You start thinking maybe you were never good at math. Maybe you were never meant to be here. You think about switching majors. You think about dropping out. You wonder if Taylor series would converge faster than your GPA is falling.<br/>WEEK 9: The Philosophical Turn.<br/>You start agreeing with Nietzsche. God is dead, and Erica killed him with a radius of convergence. You find yourself contemplating existence in lecture. You raise your hand to ask, “What does it mean for a series to truly converge?” and the TF writes a summation sign and walks away.<br/>WEEK 10: The Hollowing.<br/>You are no longer a student. You are a vessel for confusion and half&ndash;finished differentials. Your dreams are narrated by series expansions. Your nightmares are slope fields. You sit in lecture and simply accept. Acceptance is the final stage of grief. Math 1B has won.<br/>WEEK 11: The Differential Descent.<br/>The word “differential” used to sound vaguely scientific. Maybe even elegant. Now, it triggers a full&ndash;body reaction. Erica walks in, picks up the chalk, and says “Let’s solve a second&ndash;order linear nonhomogeneous differential equation,” and you start to see colors that aren’t there.<br/>You thought integrals were bad. You thought convergence tests were painful. You had no idea. Now it’s y double prime plus y prime plus y equals e^x times a cosine. You’re supposed to use undetermined coefficients. Variation of parameters. The method of annihilators. You try to look it up, but Google says “Did you mean: you’re screwed?”<br/>WEEK 12: The Breakdown, Redux.<br/>The problem sets now involve three layers of differential logic. You’re solving for particular solutions, homogeneous solutions, general solutions—at this point, you just want a solution to your life. You stare at the DE on the board and think, “This must be what it feels like to go insane slowly, beautifully, with a pencil.”<br/>You try to ask a question, but it comes out as a sound. Just a noise. Erica responds with a formula that looks like a summoning spell. You copy it down because you’ve stopped resisting. Your notebook is no longer for learning. It’s a place to document the decline.<br/>WEEK 13: The Rage.<br/>You’ve stopped suffering in silence. You curse aloud during problem sets. You type “Why does Taylor do this” into Google. You threaten to drop a major just to spite this class. You write “Help me” in your notebook and underline it 30 times. Your TF makes eye contact and flinches. You get into a fight with a friend who says, “It’s not that bad.” You cut them off. You were never that close anyway.<br/>WEEK 14: The Surrender.<br/>The final approaches. You don’t study. You prepare spiritually. You walk into the lecture hall like a condemned soul. You look around and see your classmates in various stages of denial, numbness, and caffeine&ndash;induced hysteria. Someone sharpens a pencil like it’s a sword. You nod. This is the end. You whisper “Octonauts ready for action” not as a joke—but as a prayer.<br/>✦ . 　⁺ 　 . ✦ . 　⁺ 　 . ✦<br/>THE FINAL EXAM: A LIVE&ndash;ACTION BETRAYAL<br/>They told us no food, no water, no calculator. I brought a cough drop. I was sick—sick in the way only Math 1B can make a person sick. Coughing, shaking, cold sweating through an exam that was colder than the room. A proctor approached me like I’d brought contraband. I was almost kicked out. For a cough drop. For daring to attempt basic respiratory survival during this academic deathmatch.<br/>Had I been removed, I think I would&#x27;ve finally cracked. The breakdown was brewing. Missing one more thing—one more community dinner, one more org meeting, one more birthday, one more final—might’ve been the end. This course had already taken too much. Had they removed me for that Ricola, I would’ve started speaking in series notation and crying Taylor terms.<br/>The lecture hall was quiet. Too quiet. You could feel the tension in the air as students filtered in—not chatting, not joking, just solemnly setting down mechanical pencils like weapons before a duel. You weren’t here to succeed. You were here to survive.<br/>The moment the clock hit 9:00 AM, the final exam was passed out, and the room collectively exhaled their last hope. You flipped the first page. It was already over.<br/>A second&ndash;order linear nonhomogeneous differential equation stared back at you like a death sentence. You tried to remember your method of undetermined coefficients. Your brain gave you a flashback to crying in office hours instead.<br/>By page two, someone had put their head down and wasn’t moving. By page three, you heard quiet sobbing. Page four had a parametric curve question that looked like a Rorschach test. Someone stood up, walked out, and never returned.<br/>A student in the back threw up. Another cursed audibly. The proctor didn’t even blink. This was normal. This was expected. This was Math 1B.<br/>You reached the Taylor series expansion and just stared. It wanted a 40&ndash;term expansion centered at a point that might not exist. You wrote four terms and then—without hesitation—wrote “Octonauts ready for action” at the bottom. Because what else could you do? Pray? Cry? Beg for mercy from a function?<br/>The last problem asked you to analyze convergence in a series that looked like it had been cursed by a Victorian child. You wrote “I’m sorry” in the margin.<br/>And then, somehow, it was over.<br/>You stumbled out of the lecture hall into the blinding daylight. Someone was weeping on the steps. Another was making a TikTok about the experience. You stood there, hollowed out, stripped of ego and energy—and smiled.<br/>Because it was done.<br/>Because you survived.<br/>Because despite everything—despite the conduct penalty, the sleepless nights, the cursed slope fields—you finished Math 1B.<br/>And for the first time in months, you felt joy. Real, tangible joy. The joy of walking away from the wreckage with your sanity mostly intact. Of knowing that you would never again have to write a Taylor series. Of knowing that Erica Dinkins could no longer touch you.<br/>Octonauts. Ready for freedom.<br/>EPILOGUE: A LETTER TO FUTURE FIRST&ndash;YEARS<br/>If you’re reading this, it means you’ve heard the whispers. The legends. The rumors about Math 1B. Maybe you’re a freshman—bright&ndash;eyed, determined, ready to take on Harvard’s STEM courses with the energy of a caffeinated golden retriever. Maybe someone told you it wasn’t that bad. Maybe you believed them.<br/>Don’t.<br/>Math 1B is not just a class. It is a gauntlet. A psychological operation. A semester&ndash;long fever dream of integrals, infinite series, and unspeakable differential horrors. It is a trial by fire in which you will be burned, branded, and broken—and if you’re lucky, you’ll crawl out the other side with a C+ and a ghost permanently whispering “Taylor approximation” in your ear.<br/>But you don’t have to do this. You have choices. If you can place into 21A—do it. If you can take 1A instead—bless yourself and do it. Do not let the advisors lie to you. Do not let the siren song of “everyone takes it” lull you into the abyss. If someone from the department says “it builds character,” understand they mean it in the same way a collapsed bridge builds swimming skills.<br/>And if you’ve already committed—brace yourself. Arm yourself. Find your people. Make a meme folder. Go to office hours, even if only to sob quietly into your notebook. Watch lectures on 2x speed and let the confusion wash over you like a wave. Drink water. Sleep when you can. Mourn what you lose, celebrate what you finish.<br/>You will forget the math. But you will never forget the madness.<br/>Sincerely,<br/>A survivor of the series.<br/>&ndash;<br/>ON TF Trainor &amp; CourseHead Dinkins<br/>Let’s not pretend. Let’s not tiptoe. Let’s talk about what it actually feels like to be in Math 1B, sitting under those godforsaken fluorescent lights while Erica Dinkins—the Course Head, the CEO of Cold Disdain, the Grand Inquisitor of Convergence—waltzes into the room with the emotional warmth of a malfunctioning Roomba.<br/>From the moment she steps in, the temperature drops. I’m not kidding. It physically feels colder. She has that presence—icy, distant, surgical. She doesn’t walk, she glides, like some sort of cryptic math spirit summoned by the cries of struggling freshmen.<br/>And you? You, sitting there with your notebook open and a half&ndash;chewed pencil in your hand, think to yourself: “I have a question. A real question. A good&ndash;faith question.” And you raise your hand. Slowly. Nervously. Hoping this will be the day the room finally turns human.<br/>But she turns to you. And that look—God, that look—is something you feel in your bones. Like she’s already done a triple integral of your soul and found it lacking. She doesn’t ask you what your question is. She doesn’t encourage. She just says, with that edge in her voice, “We already covered that.”<br/>Or worse: she answers your question with another question—abstract, symbolic, disembodied—and you’re left even more confused, now deeply ashamed, and maybe even wondering if you imagined the whole lecture.<br/>There were moments—moments burned into memory—where she’d write a horrifying expression on the board and say “this should be clear” while half the room was blinking like hostages. I saw people sweating, physically sweating, while trying to follow her derivation of a power series expansion around a point she pulled from the underworld. She once solved an entire differential equation in what I can only describe as emotional Morse code—rapid, hostile chalk movements—and when someone asked her to explain step three, she turned and looked like they’d just spit on Euclid.<br/>It’s not that she didn’t teach. It’s that she didn’t teach us. She taught ghosts. She taught theoretical students who already took Math 21A in the womb. If you weren’t in the top 5% of math fluency, you didn’t exist to her. You were an inconvenience. A background hum. Static in the calculus frequency she operated on.<br/>I started doubting myself in that room. Started shrinking. Started losing my voice. You don’t realize it at first, but it chips away at you. A comment here. A sigh there. A refusal to acknowledge the question that was maybe your one shot at getting it. And by the time Week 8 rolled around, I wasn’t asking anymore. I wasn’t engaging. I was surviving.<br/>But then there was Charlotte.<br/>And if I talk about Erica with fire, I talk about Charlotte with full&ndash;hearted, tear&ndash;streaked reverence.<br/>Charlotte is the kind of TF you write novels about. The kind of academic mentor you remember forever. She didn’t just help me understand the material. She helped me remember that I wasn’t stupid. That I still had value as a learner. That even though I wasn’t writing 40&ndash;term Taylor series in my sleep like some math cyborg, I was still worthy of kindness. Of patience.<br/>She never made me feel small. She never looked at me with that Erica&ndash;brand scorn. She would pause—pause mid&ndash;sentence—to make sure you were following. And if you weren’t, she wouldn’t move on. She’d go back. She’d re&ndash;explain. She’d ask what step lost you and trace it out carefully, like she was untangling a knot she wanted to help you loosen.<br/>There were nights—real, painful nights—where I would come to her with PSETs that looked like they’d been through a shredder. And she didn’t flinch. She’d say, “Okay. Let’s figure this out.” And those four words? They saved me. She made math feel like something I could try again. Not conquer. Not master. Just try.<br/>Charlotte made it safe to fail. Erica made it shameful.<br/>And that’s the difference. That’s the core of it.<br/>One woman walked in each day with an arsenal of equations and an air of silent judgment. The other walked in with a whiteboard marker and a heart.<br/>I don’t know what would’ve happened without Charlotte. I genuinely don’t. Because by Week 10, I was losing it. I was losing myself. But she reminded me that Math 1B didn’t get to define me. That I was more than a percent, more than a boxed final answer with a red X. She reminded me that learning is a process, not a punishment.<br/>So yeah—Erica ran the show. But Charlotte? Charlotte saved it.<br/>And if no one else says it, I will: give that woman a raise. Give her tenure. Give her the course. Because she taught with grace in a system built to break us.<br/>And I’ll never forget that.</td>

If you actually go to class it is pretty easy honestly, and you should be able to do well with some hard work. Going to MQC is honestly kind of a cheat code, and it makes your PSET average go way up since you are told how to do things in a way that will make the graders give you more points. If you are looking at skipping this and going straight to 21, look into the course material and see how well you know it, beause this class sets up both 21A and 21B in a lot of its material.</td>
