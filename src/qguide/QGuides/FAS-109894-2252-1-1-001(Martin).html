But. Consider taking this AFTER EC10A, WHATEVER ELSE EVERYONE SAYS. Professors will say, &quot;You covered this in Ec10A,&quot; or &quot;You remember, so we won&#x27;t go over this,&quot; and then you just sit there with double the work. Be aware of the fact that multiple choice is tricky and does not always reflect your expectations. I attended all the lectures and sections, did all of the credit and extra credit tasks, and still managed to mess up greatly on midterm and finals: not because I don&#x27;t know the material but just because of how badly I get confused in multiple choice. Also, it would be beneficial if you have a background in economics overall. Otherwise, it would be a bit difficult.</td>

Try to at least attempt psets on your own or work through them with a group rather than just have someone tell you what to do, otherwise you will be scrambling to learn all of the content at the end. For me, definitely Ec10b was harder than Ec10a, but also generally more interesting since it covers a wider range of topics. Prepare for exams by studying for different kinds of questions, and try to explain intuitions about how different components move using supply&ndash;and&ndash;demand graphs or UIP curve or Phillips Curve. Overall a pretty good class and try to go to lectures at least sometimes.</td>

I took AP macroeconomics in high school, but I feel like a lot of the content in this course isn&#x27;t taught in the AP course. Yes, some content may overlap, but in general, compared to EC10A&#x2F;AP micro, there is less repetition.

It&#x27;s imperative that you find a TF that melds with your style of learning. Your grades WILL reflect. I changed from one TF to another, and found the content to not only easier to digest, but also improvements to PSET grading and office hours opportunities. The key to Ec10b is find a consistent office hour time&ndash;block with a consistent TF. Align this with the PSET drop and spawn kill it as soon as Thursday rolls around. The final is a la carte Ec10a &quot;All 5 may be right, pick the most right + all are true + all are false&quot;. If you&#x27;re new to this type of examination, it&#x27;s essential that you take many practice exams and are able to articulate why the other answers aren&#x27;t &quot;the most right&quot;, if you catch my drift. Anyways,  let this be a gut check. I enjoyed 10b more than 10a, but ultimately have decided to pursue a STEM concentration. While you may learn a great deal between 10a&#x2F;b, you&#x27;re left without any abilities to create and without a committed faculty of support (e.g., the incredible Math MQC ecosystem or CS&#x2F; APMTH&#x2F; engineering tracks which offer more math&#x2F;logic&#x2F; toolkits).</td>

Still, definitely good to know what a stock actually is and how the Fed works (as someone who didn&#x27;t take AP econ in high school). Felt very applicable to real life. Lectures are excellent and if you pay attention to them you can get by without doing the readings (thought you should look at the textbook if you&#x27;re lost with a pset). Go to section, not only because it&#x27;s required but because it&#x27;s useful and the material is tested. Do the practice tests before midterm and final and you&#x27;ll be fine</td>

Obviously, the fact that the exams determine the bulk of your grade means that they are more high pressure and can seem like they do not truly evaluate your understanding of the course material&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;but that is understandable given how many people take the course.

My one thing to note is that the PSETs are very easy in this course. Although this is good during the term because there are only about 3 hours of work per week, gaps in my knowledge really started to show when I was studying for exams (especially as someone who didn&#x27;t take econ in high school) and I think I could have done better if I was forced to spend more time on econ every week.</td>

The midterm and final are quite hard and the lectures are boring, so it&#x27;s hard to stay focused.

By the end of the year, I was not convinced that macroeconomics and macroeconomic policy was interesting: the stereotype of stuffy suits being the power players behind economics were reinforced with lectures and guest lectures, sadly. It seemed that the Harvard bubble is the perfect breeding ground for being a macroeconomist and I honestly do not want any part in that. I did very much like the lectures about the 2009 financial crisis though. Really cool to see the background behind some events that concerned many Americans. That is honestly a problem with this class: most of it seems far too separate from the Average American. It would be helpful just to take a couple of minutes (not just once every month) to break down how macroeconomics connects to everyday people.</td>

I have a much better understanding of how the macroeconomy functions, from the role of the Fed to the effects of tariffs to the stock market. <br/><br/>The lectures were well&ndash;developed. The course did not include much fine detail and instead focused more on developing our intuition about macroeconomics; without prior experience in macroeconomics, I valued this approach. It allowed me to understand macroeconomics as a whole before deciding whether I want to explore the area in more depth. However, if you have taken macroeconomics in the past, this course might not be challenging enough. Additionally, some of Jason&#x27;s lectures felt dry and dragged on a little. The content was interesting, but I think he could have presented it with greater tonal variation and expressivity.<br/><br/>The guest lectures were incredible. When David and Jason discussed topics in class, they mentioned some of the most important research on that topic, and the guest lectures were usually part of that research! I felt lucky to be exposed to such giants in economics!<br/><br/>However, I would have liked a more diverse range of guest speakers. Most of them were academics or politicians, and I would have liked to hear from more industry experts, such as bankers.<br/><br/>The psets improved my grasp of the content. I especially liked how they reflected present&ndash;day events, like the effects of Covid and tariffs. Through them, I applied what I had learned in class and became more confident with the material.<br/><br/>The problem&ndash;solving sessions are an incredible resource. The CAs helped me work through the psets and understand the concepts involved. They were all nice and supportive. <br/><br/>The unit review program is also quite valuable. By studying for them, I consolidated my understanding of the material. The feedback I got after taking them showed me how well I had learned the content and where I should focus my studying. <br/><br/>Because the problem&ndash;solving sessions and unit review program are so useful, I would highly suggest attending them<br/><br/>The tests do a good job of testing our understanding and problem&ndash;solving skills. The practice tests are a very useful resource to study for them; in fact, I think some of the questions were essentially identical to the tests.</td>

The content is fascinating, and you really learn how to critically assess economic news and other things going on in the real world. I thought David and Jason were great lecturers, and Junaiid Khan as a section leader was quite phenomenal. David Martin’s review lectures and office hours and how he explains concepts I will never get how he does so well. The teaching staff is so responsive on the slack; organizationally, given the size of this class, it is one of the most effectively run at Harvard.<br/><br/>The exams are fine. The midterm definitely was easier than the final. The final had a lot of tricky questions where you had to figure out some hidden wording in the question that actually meant a ton! But just do every single practice exam they give you, and you’ll get a survey on the question style for the exam. They like to assess itty bitty details on lecture slides as well, so pay attention.

Some people struggle on midterm and final but you&#x27;re given every tool in the world to get a 90% on both if you repeatedly take the practice exams and attend lecture throughout the semester.
