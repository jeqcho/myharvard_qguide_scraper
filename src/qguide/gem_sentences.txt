KC (Kassandra Diaz) IS THE BEST SECTION LEADER I'VE EVER HAD!!! This course was so much fun, engaging, and was light–ish on the work! Has ALOT of GEM qualities, but the main take–away here is that you will most likely get an A/A– if you show up! Participation/Attendance to all the sections, lectures, and screenings is a big component of the grade! I know people that slacked off and didn't show up many times and that is a deduction to the grade! Its a GEM if you do the Attendance! KC grades the assignments VERY FAIR! If you paid just a little bit of attention, you are guaranteed to do well on the assignments! The Final Quiz is not hard, the study guide is basically what you'll find on the quiz and it makes it VERY manageable! The thing I found perhaps a little annoying is that there is a strict "no laptop" policy! You can have an IPAD but laptops for some reason are a no go! But aside from that I HIGHLY reccomend this course if you are willing to go to all the attendence! The content is genuinley interesting and I promise you you won't regret taking this! TRY TO HAVE KC (Kassandra Diaz) AS YOUR SECTION LEADER! Professor Yoda is so knowledgeable on the subject and is very nice! The assignemnts are very manegable and even the "BIG" assignment – the Podcast assignment – was very manageable! I started it the day before and still got an A :): 0.9796

 It's not entirely a gem in that you have some pretty heavy writing to do, but this is certainly not a super high–stress class: -0.0049
Take this class! It is definitely not a gem, Professor Halford is a tough grader, but it is a really interesting course and you will learn a lot! Come prepared to read and write! The subjects you discuss in this class are very interesting which makes the class better as a whole! It was a new class this year and I imagine it will get better and better over time: 0.9768

I originally told my friends that I would joke around and put nothing but “Gem” on my Qguide review, but as the only undergrad in the course this year (now Pragya knows exactly who is writing this so I better watch what I say), I feel like I should accept at least a little bit of responsibility and give an actual review for any undergrads who are thinking of taking this course: 0.9373
Put in the work!!! This class can be a gem, but you will only get what you put in: 0.0
