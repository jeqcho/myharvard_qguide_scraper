The problem sets are A LOT and challenging, but if you go to office hours, you can get it done and understand it pretty well. I only got through this course because I BUSTED my a** going to min. 3 office hours a week (coming from someone who had no coding &#x2F; stat experience) and I&#x27;m still pretty sure I failed the final LOL. <br/><br/>The lecture goes really fast and is super hard to follow, but James and Mark both were so willing to stay after class and explain things to me (because I&#x27;m slow). That, I really appreciated. And I can tell how much they both love this course and topics. The OH and TFs were also amazing and I credit them for being able to get through this course.<br/><br/>The midterm wasn&#x27;t bad but the final....no words. I felt so overwhelmed and unprepared for it because the second half of the course goes by so quickly.

			<td class="TabularBody_LeftColumn" headers="comment-2_bfc5a2cd-2dbe-457f-8c8e-805bcfb483ce">I lowkey hated every second of this class. It seems really promising at first, but like it is deceptively easy. You go to the first lecture and everything is all smiles and rainbows. Then you know you get the first PSET and they lowkey like hold your hand throughout that, and it is super easy. Immediately after the first few lectures, like right after the first topic, INCREDIBLY DIFFICULT. Like lowkey the most frustrating part was the fact that you are using R and learning code. Yes, it is not that bad if you have experience, but as someone who did not, I struggled until the last second of the class, literally catch me on the final not answering questions because I did not know what to do.<br/>It is literally so annoying that there are no pre&ndash;reqs for the course, yet like you lowkey need some coding and stats experience. Also I hate the coding portion of the class. Like literally I work with statistics in a research lab and I do not need to code. Yes, it is valuable, but I fear it&#x27;s becoming outdated unless you absolutely want to work in straight statistics. I think that this course would be so much better if they like focused more on stats, rather than R. It became so frustrating trying to balance two things at once, because you are basically taking two different classes at the same time. It is unfortunate that this is an introductory course because IT IS HARD.</td>

Grading on psets was very nit&ndash;picky and it felt like they didn&#x27;t focus on my understanding of the material but rather looked for any opportunity to dock off points. Also no pset keys were released which makes me think that grading was subjective, it seems like each TF had different expectations for what should be included in your answers and office hours were necessary to get the right answer. Expectations about both the midterm and the upcoming final exam are extremely unclear and the teaching team hasn&#x27;t exactly helped answer our questions...<br/><br/>Also, I&#x27;m not sure how the grading is going to work out because the mean for the midterm was a 75% and the curve will make that the B+&#x2F;A&ndash; cutoff?<br/><br/> Shoutout to Dicle for being a great TF.<br/><br/><br/>Overall, I would recommend a different introductory stats course instead.</td>

As a senior, this definitely ranks among the worst courses I&#x27;ve taken at Harvard. The professors and course staff are kind people and are accessible to the students, but this course is extremely poorly organized, horribly taught, and has major inconsistencies between the structure&#x2F;difficulty of problem sets and the exams. The best way I can describe this class is as if someone promised to teach you the alphabet and you expected them to start with A and slowly make their way to B, C, D, etc. and instead they gave you a Caesar cipher that you had to decode yourself. It felt like the professors were running a review class for people who already had substantial knowledge of statistics and did not care to break it down for those of us with little exposure to the subject.<br/><br/>1. First, the lectures are nearly impossible to follow. I attended almost every lecture in&ndash;person and focused entirely on taking notes on the material, but it was extremely difficult to understand what was going on because the professors never gave a &quot;roadmap&quot; for the lecture, would intersperse the coding details randomly within the slides, and would provide examples for the topic before even explaining the basic terms. There were derivations interspersed with R code interspersed with actual formulas you needed. Even after spending hours trying to decipher the lecture slides, I had a LOT of difficulty trying to understand what exactly they were trying to say. The organization of the slides was a mess.<br/><br/>2. The professors had great difficulty keeping up with their own lecture pacing. We often did not finish the slides by the end of lectures and this meant that we were perpetually behind... to the point that the professors covered 2 entire units in the last two days of class. This made it even more difficult to understand what was going on. I think most students were lost by the 10th minute of each lecture and never quite understood what was happening.<br/><br/>3. The problem sets required skills that were not taught during class. The R coding was significantly more difficult than anything that we had been shown in class. More than once, a professor had to issue a correction to provide the class with code that we simply had not been taught.<br/><br/>4. The exams do not even CLOSELY resemble the kind of work that we were doing in class. The midterm exam was very long and challenging &ndash; there was no coding despite the huge amount of coding that we had been doing on the problem sets. On the final exam, there were several questions where the material had NOT BEEN TAUGHT to the students, or material that we had been told would definitely not be tested. This is simply unacceptable for ANY course.<br/><br/>5. Sections are completely useless. There are no practice questions, so it basically became just a problem set happy hour. It is the responsibility of the head teaching staff to develop useful material for section time. Mark repeatedly claimed that the course did not have the &quot;resources&quot; to make practice questions, but for a class with 300+ enrollees and tens of TFs, this is a truly absurd statement.<br/><br/>As a pre&ndash;med student, I hoped that this course would equip me with the skills to do basic data analysis in lab, or a social science program.

This semester was no exception. Under the leadership of new course heads Xenakis and Glickman, the course has radically realigned to focus on the basic fundamentals of probability and statistics and remove the focus on data science and coding in R (for example, we only coded for the 6 PSETs, most of which required minimal coding and only used base R). This means if you are interested in the science of probability and frightened by the prospect of coding then this may be the course for you. However, if you are looking to gain the tools to analyze data in R for a thesis or project, I would look elsewhere as this current iteration of the course has really devalued the applied data science portion and R coding skills. For me, this was a disappointment as I was hoping to exit the course with fluency in R as I exited Ec50 with fluency in Stata. This is certainly a tradeoff as Stat 100 might better prepare for a Stats Concentration, but currently does not teach much about data science. However, this was Xenakis and Glickman&#x27;s first attempt at the course and both are clearly caring, so I hope the course will continue to evole and improve next year.</td>

If, however, you don&#x27;t care about retaining stats or coding knowledge, then there are probably easier classes. Keep up with the content throughout the semester because you will find yourself in a very tough spot if you don&#x27;t. The psets are super helpful for understanding and applying the content. Go to office hours and ask lots of questions, it&#x27;s super helpful. Be wary that the communication in this class from the teaching staff is not always super clear. There were quite a few instances where there was content on the psets&#x2F;exams that was either not taught or completely breezed over in lecture. Before exams, it sort of felt like we were not being set up for success (not enough practice problems, unclear as to what the content would be). That being said, the teaching staff is lovely and accessible so approach them and ask questions. Overall, this class is challenging and can be a little frustrating, but (as someone who is a psych concentrator) it is manageable.</td>

This is not out of any spite either, and all my advice comes as someone who is poised to get a A or A&ndash; in the class, and is a concentrator in Statistics who has familiarity with most of the material through AP Stats and personal exploration. This class has changed a lot from last year, and everyone in the course has no clue what is going on. I looked at a friend&#x27;s notes&#x2F;study guide from last year, and it seemed to be primarily data visualization with some basic stats concepts. This is not that. This is simple statistical concepts taught like it&#x27;s PHD level material.<br/><br/>Assignments:<br/>6 problem sets. The first 3 are so insanely easy that it is mind&ndash;numbing and you will be wondering why Glickman and Xenakis are asking you such illuminating questions as &quot;how many entries are in this table?&quot; or asking you to calculate expected values&#x2F;means 6 TIMES IN A ROW for slightly different situations. Problem set 4 is moderate, and is in my opinion where the problem sets should ACTUALLY start. To be completely honest, the first 3 problem sets are trivial, and mostly just for grade inflation (I&#x27;m not complaining, but this could just as easily be fixed by making the last 2 and the midterm easier). Problem sets 5 and 6 are when the course just throws you into the deep end with asking you to perform the same procedures on slightly different examples (this is a recurring theme throughout the course!) over and over and over again. Besides this, the grades as really strict with their interpretations, despite Glickman and Xenakis being the most handwavy people in all of Harvard in the lecture notes.<br/><br/>Feedback:<br/>On each problem set, you can expect to reviece feedback that is trivial at best, and completely asinine&#x2F;wrong at worst. This feedback&#x27;s only purpose seems to be to drag your grade on each pset down by 0.25 to 1 point so the course does not seem like it is too easy. Expect to look forward to such as examples as &quot;instead of a &ndash; b = 0, you should have written that a = b&quot;  and &quot;why is this true&quot; when the question asks no such thing. Look forward to tediously checking your code to make sure that it does not run off the page (because R somehow does not prevent this)! Get a buddy to go to OH and collaborate on PSETS with (you are allowed to do so) because this is going to be one long ride.<br/><br/>Sections:<br/>Sections are optional. They are just the section leader re&ndash;teaching some of the material from lecture and helping you work through the PSETs. This is good! A word of caution though: sometimes your section leader will have NO CLUE what they are talking about. This course changed drastically from last year, so at the start, my section leader had no clue what was going on, and I ACTUALLY HAD TO CORRECT MY SECTION LEADER ON SOME OCCASIONS. This should NEVER be the case in ANY Harvard class. <br/><br/>Material:<br/>This class is literally just AP Stats, with an automated R component for hypothesis tests and confidence intervals. Don&#x27;t get excited though, because this class somehow makes AP Stats&#x27; high&ndash;school level material so complex as to seem like a grad&ndash;school level class. Why are we spending like an entire 3 lessons and 100 slides on what a random variable is? Why are we ramming ANOVA, Linear Regession (simple AND multiple), and Chi&ndash;Squared into a week? What happened to time management? Why is there 20 pages on the most basic probability laws that could have been stated on 1&ndash;3 pages? Why is every single slideshow littered with 5+ examples that obfuscate the knowledge&#x2F;rules and aren&#x27;t even clear on what they are doing? Why is the R command for procedures only introduced on a small subsection of the page after you have computed things by hand for the past 1&ndash;2 hours? Why do you CONTINUE to compute things by hand? Why do we dive less into the theory of how procedures are structured and interpreted. WHY DO WE LOOK AT 30 SLIDE&#x27;S WORTH OF MATH DERIVATIONS THAT WE WILL NEVER USE IN THE CLASS? These are just some of the mind&ndash;baffling questions you will ask in Stat 100. If 102, 104, etc are anything like this, I have no clue why one would even want to take them. Hopefully last year was not like this, and next year won&#x27;t be either.<br/><br/>Midterm:<br/>This class is supposed to teach you R. You learn R in the first 3 weeks. But for some reason, you use NO R AT ALL ON THE MIDTERM. You calculate everything by hand, and what&#x27;s more, THE MIDTERM IS AN ABSOLUTE RACE. They only give you an hour and a half or so for 6 multi&ndash;part problem, so it&#x27;s essentially you racing through the problems and trying to rush through everything as fast as possible. You will have little to no time to check your work. The average was a 70, or so I was told. Several people had no clue what they were doing, which speaks to Glickman and Xenakis&#x27; sheer incompetence.<br/><br/>Lecture experience:<br/>Lectures are optional, and thank God they are. Glickman and Xenakis ramble off of their confusing slides for hours on end, and I have legitimately fallen asleep during class out of sheer boredom and woken up to find them covering THE SAME CONCEPT, which as per usual was the most simple concept (what a shocking concept that all probability distributions have area under the curve equal to 1!). If you are not a STEM person looking for an easy but frustrating grade boost, I would caution against this class. There are other, easier, or less unfuriating classes for your math requirements. This class is a complete disaster, and it is my opinion and Xenakis and Glickman should not be allowed to teach a class again. If they have mangled material that high&ndash;schoolers have little trouble with this badly, I shudder to think of how they have butchered higher&ndash;level concepts.<br/><br/>Conclusion&#x2F;TLDR:<br/>Genuinely, fire the course heads. Glickman and Xenakis make everything so much more complicated than it needs to be. Lectures were a series in patience, with Glickman and Xenakis gleefully taking turns reading off the slides (and not elaborating!) in the most uninterested and boring way possible. Let&#x27;s talk about the slides. These monstrosities are the most bloated and confusing coverage of statistical material that ANYONE could possibly have created. Each one is 40 slides that somehow get turned into 80, hampering my review, because the course heads do not know how to sanitize their slideshows. Mind you, there is only about 10&ndash;20 important slides&#x27; worth of information. The rest is legitimately just bloated overcomplication, confusing diagrams, or examples past the one or two I think is required. TRIM DOWN THE SLIDES! And actually focus on the R commands instead of turning this into a half&ndash;baked, pretentious rehash of AP Stats with half the clarity. <br/><br/>I pray that next year&#x27;s course will not be such a disgrace to Harvard and all of academia.</td>

That&#x27;s a fine choice, in my view, and very possibly even the right one, given the advent of LLMs that can help you figure out how to do relatively simple programming, which is all most people in the course will ever need to do with R. My major problem with this course — and it was a ~really~ major problem for me — was that it was totally inconsistent in aligning policies, practices, and assignments with this (seeming) emphasis.<br/><br/>In lecture, we almost exclusively learned about statistics, with only very brief discussion of how we apply the concepts from lecture in R. If you consult the lectures slides, most of which ran between 40 and 60 slides, you’d find that perhaps four or five contain any code whatsoever, and after the first week or two, we received zero instruction in how to code ‘well’ — good syntax, in&ndash;line commenting, etc.<br/><br/>I found it confusing, then, that our problem sets were ~exclusively~ in R, often involving only relatively trivial applications of the math we learned in lecture. For most problem sets, I spent substantially more time trying to figure out how to do something in R than considering how to solve the problem. There’s nothing per se wrong with that, but it was clearly out of step with the lectures, and as such it created lots of confusion, frustration, and discouragement for students, and less learning than a different approach might’ve.<br/><br/>I was especially frustrated when the midterm rolled around, because it was exclusively pen&ndash;and&ndash;paper math with no coding in R. That’s fine and probably actually good for a class focusing on statistics — I learned a lot from it and found it rigorous — but it was the first time we’d been asked to apply stats concepts flexibly in complicated scenarios, which the problem sets basically did not have us do. I was really frustrated studying for the midterm, for this reason, and I did well, but many of my classmates did not.<br/><br/>The final exam, perplexingly and with no real warning, changed the focus yet again. It was divided into two halves — one in R, one on paper — and the computer section was dramatically harder than the paper math section. In significant part, the computer section was much harder because we had hardly been taught how to code by the course and had never had to code without access to lecture notes, office hours, and LLMs that can advise on programming basics, so many students simply couldn’t execute certain things in R. Meanwhile, the paper section was almost trivially easy, much easier than the midterm, and only required about half the allotted 90 minutes. <br/><br/>There were also some more run&ndash;of&ndash;the&ndash;mill problems that bear noting. In particular, I found lectures did not add much value over reading the slides, though I attended almost all lectures. There was, in my opinion, too little elaboration about some really key concepts (we never received explanation about what a t&ndash;distribution is, even though t&ndash;distributions followed us through like half the course). There was also a lot of unintroduced math terminology that I have to imagine confused people who have taken little&ndash;to&ndash;no college math, which is many people in this course. Finally, I really think well&ndash;known courses owe it to students to announce that they’re changing their focus when they are: I would probably have taken this course anyway if I knew it was going to emphasize statistics more heavily, but that probably wouldn’t have been the case for some others.</td>

I will try. Here&#x27;s what I did to overcome that (and what you should do, too, if you&#x27;re worried): <br/><br/>&ndash; I was at office hours every week 3+ times and met most of the (almost 30) TFs (shoutout Kassandra, she&#x27;s the best), so I took full advantage of the robust support network that this course offers. Go for p&ndash;set help because you will need it, especially if they continue to expect you to come up with code that was never taught &ndash; you genuinely will not be able to figure it out otherwise.<br/>&ndash; Rewatch all of the lectures. Sure, go in&ndash;person too... even though they go way too fast + the slides are poorly explained + they cover only the surface&ndash;level of the code you&#x27;ll need on the p&ndash;sets... but dedicate time in the semester to rewatch every lecture as slow as you need to. You&#x27;ll still probably be confused, but not as much!<br/>&ndash; Take advantage of the open notes for the test. I know people who printed all of their p&ndash;sets, even a girl who printed all of the slides from the whole class. But keep in mind that the tests force you to move quickly because they intentionally give you much less time than other exams would. This is why the midterm average was a 70 even with everyone having open notes at their disposal &ndash; I know people who skipped entire multi&ndash;part questions because they did not have time. I&#x27;ll also add that I did well above average on the midterm, so if *I* am what would be considered somebody who is &quot;doing well in the class,&quot; this class is so cooked. <br/>&ndash; Don&#x27;t overestimate the help from your peers. This semester, after the midterm, I know so many of my classmates (who I thought would be in this mess together with me) who either dropped the class or switched to SAT&#x2F;UNSAT. And I think that is a testament to how bad this class is taught &amp; run.<br/><br/>The only reason I took this class is for the Econ requirement, and I truly wish I had just taken 104 instead. It might be &quot;a little more difficult conceptually&quot; but remember that everything is difficult in this course conceptually because it is not taught well!!! Mark and James are great guys but, unfortunately, they leave a lot to be desired when it comes to teaching this class. Genuinely the worst class I have taken at Harvard thus far and it&#x27;s a shame because other introductory courses here (Ec10, for example, which I&#x27;ve also taken) have the great support network that this class does AND professors who teach it incredibly well. If there is a professor change for this course and, hopefully, subsequent structural changes, then it might not be as bad. But just know what you&#x27;re getting into. Nobody that I&#x27;ve met had a good time in Stat 100.</td>

The exams are nothing like the p&ndash;sets and loosely resemble the practice exams they give you. They often asked ridiculous questions on exams with an expectation you would know everything from the course (yes even that one detail on one slide two months ago... oh and also that one calculation they told you you would probably never do in real life and as such didn&#x27;t even provide the formula for in the slides) so yeah good luck with that guessing game on the exam, may the odds be ever in your favor.  The worst part of it all is that I genuinely felt like I understood everything in the course, I was doing well on p&ndash;sets, going to office hours , studying an insane amount of time and genuinely had a solid grasp of the material but still bombed the exams. It just sucks when you put in so much effort and thats not reflected in your grade. And they say &quot;oh we will curve it, the class median will be an a&ndash;&#x2F;b+&quot; or something like that but no one wants to compete with their peers for grades, we want to work together and be asked honest and fair questions on an exam so that we can be graded on our own merit. Its not intro to stat that I hate, its quite literally just this course. Take another stat class, spare yourself the woes of this class.

PLEASE DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS. PLEASE DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS. AGAIN, PLEASE DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS.<br/><br/>STAT 100 started off as a course that students use to recommend with flying colors, especially due to having take&ndash;home digital midterm and final exams. In the past, STAT 100 used to be a class where an A is attainable as long as you work hard. However, beginning in Fall 2024 when the original professor left, the class has gone through extremely unpopular changes and has been made consistently worse and worse.<br/><br/>This semester, the course was led by Mark Glickman and James Xenakis, two professors within the Statistics department. While they seem like nice people and give effective lectures, the course itself has become extremely unenjoyable… and honestly pure MISERABLE. <br/><br/>First, in terms of the content, the course is taught in R, with all Problem Sets being coding&ndash;based and relating well to the lecture. However, the midterm format was shifted to be on paper, which made absolutely NO SENSE. While students did not have to write code on paper, they instead had to apply concepts in a way that had never previously been practiced since we are only used to doing everything digitally through code. As a result, this leads to a major gap in application, as it is extremely difficult to translate work we have been doing fully through R to suddenly being in a different format on paper.<br/><br/>To make matters worse, the midterm was 15 pages long, resulting in many students either not finishing or barely finishing within the allotted 1 hour 15 minute time block. Then, the final blow came in the form of practice content prior to the exam. Seeing how it was the first time that the midterm was taken on paper, students continuously asked for more practice questions to be released. However, the staff only ended up releasing 1 practice exam, citing “limited resources” for their reasoning behind why they weren’t able to release more. Instead, they referred students to do practice problems from the STAT 100 textbook which ended up being a complete waste of time and completely UNREPRESENTATIVE of what was actually on the exam. <br/><br/>Following the midterm, the mean ended up being a 73.8 and the median ended up being a 76.5, which is significantly lower than what has previously been the case for STAT 100 in previous semesters. However, the professors seemed extremely happy with these results, stating that it was exactly on par with what they were aiming for (with hopes of the final average grade being between a B+&#x2F;A&ndash;). Although many students ended up opting to shift to Pass&#x2F;Fail the course following this, there are also many students that are unable to take this option, whether it be because of pre&ndash;med or concentration requirements. As a result, we are now at the mercy of the professors to see how they will end up curving&#x2F;scaling the grades at the very end &ndash; although I remain extremely unenthusiastic upon hearing their desired average grade. <br/><br/>Then, the issues continued to persist with the final, which consisted of half coding&ndash;based and half paper&ndash;based portions. For the coding&ndash;based portion, first, there were significant issues with the file the course staff provided, with multiple students being unable to open the files and losing time as a result. Additionally, they also implemented a policy where only PAPER notes were allowed for the exam, even during the digital coding portion. This makes no sense given the digital nature of the exam, and also slows students down significantly. To make matters worse, there was also rampant cheating during the final exam with students using ChatGPT in the final rows where they faced less monitoring. Seeing how this class is intended to be scaled, this creates an extremely unfair and uneven playing field for the students that are actually trying to do well on their own. At this point, we are praying for the mercy of our instructors to do well in the course, which doesn’t even seem attainable anymore at this point. <br/><br/>Overall, I think that STAT 100 is a class that is NOT recommendable anymore. It is extremely poorly run from an assessment perspective, and seeing how the exams together account for 65% of your grade, doing poorly on one portion alone will RUIN your performance in the class as a whole. To any student that has an alternative option for Statistics, PLEASE TAKE IT. Do NOT take STAT 100 unless they revert it back to be more realistic and reasonable. If it remains like this, I would advise against taking STAT 100 if at all possible.</td>

Look into taking PSYCH1900 instead, which I have only heard positive or neutral feedback about from my premed peers who took the course. Also consider STAT 102 unless you really can&#x27;t find a way to make either of these classes work. I would also recommend waiting until the structure of the course stabilizes for at least one semester before taking it. This semester&#x27;s feedback may not be representative of the experience you will get if you take STAT 100 next semester because they are changing the structure of the course again, but the way the course was set up this semester was tragically disorganized. It was their first time running this iteration of the course after the previous professor left and it really showed. Because there was only one midterm and one final, if you messed up on the midterm, you felt like you were screwed the entire semester. This class stressed me out immensely throughout the whole semester and despite studying for the final exam 5&ndash;10 hours a day for basically all of reading period and the final exam period, I still felt like I was going to do poorly going into the exam. This was not for lack of trying to review and prepare for the final exam prior to the start of reading period either. Some of the decisions I truly do not understand why they made. Despite all of the problem sets being based in R, midterm and half of the final was based entirely on paper without testing coding, despite that being all you practice. They seemed to still be making these decisions up until a couple weeks before the actual exam date, which was not helpful. When asked for more practice problems, the course staff told you to look at the textbook that nobody used because they didn&#x27;t have the bandwidth to write more practice problems and only delivered on this a month before the final. I personally struggled to understand James&#x27;s lectures as someone who did not have any sort of prior statistics background; it felt like he would be better suited for lecturing to more advanced students, although he was always friendly and ready to try to supplement his lectures with additional explanations, whether they helped you understand or not. For me, Mark was better at breaking down concepts in a way that could help you develop a better intuitive understanding behind the content, although his lecture pace was slower as a result (but I appreciated because it often allowed me to gain a better foundation for the later content). TFs and office hours were a godsend. Please go to your sections and try to understand the statistical concepts behind the problems in office hours. Problem sets were difficult and time&ndash;consuming for me and sometimes were really confusing because course staff sometimes forgot to give us code that we needed to do a problem or didn&#x27;t cover the data wrangling that a problem required in lecture and had to supplement with additional announcements. Sometimes it felt like there was a disconnect between lectures and problem sets because from a conversation I had with a TF, they weren&#x27;t written by the lecturers. If you choose to take this class, please do not underestimate it. Expect to spend possibly 10+ hours a week on the class if you are starting from 0 without a strong math&#x2F;stat background and do not fall behind on your review. If you get complacent and fall behind, it can be extremely overwhelming to catch up.</td>

They gave 1 practice test and it wasn&#x27;t even much like the actual exam. Then, when someone asked if there could be more practice posted on Canvas they said (and I quote): &quot;We don&#x27;t have the resources to make more practice exams&quot; ????? wtf does that mean? if you don&#x27;t &quot;have the resources&quot; to make more then I don&#x27;t have the resources to take the test!!! For the final, they gave more practice, but its all practice from like 2012 &ndash; literally even in the review session hosted by the TFs all the practice was over 10 years old and often had mistakes or concepts we didn&#x27;t end up needing on the test. I don&#x27;t think they understood how much help the students needed.<br/>The only good part about the class was the TFs &ndash;&gt; they were so helpful and kind and even agreed with us often that the professors don&#x27;t teach the concepts well at all.<br/>Seriously, TAKE ANY OTHER CLASS</td>

Especially if you do have a packed schedule, this class will sneak up on you in ways you will not anticipate. The lectures are not the most engaging due to it being a large class and aren&#x27;t the most structured, so it&#x27;s hard to understand both if you go or don&#x27;t go to lecture and just rewatch. This might change in the next semester but really make sure you don&#x27;t ignore this class if you don&#x27;t have a stat background.</td>

			<td class="TabularBody_LeftColumn" headers="comment-2_bfc5a2cd-2dbe-457f-8c8e-805bcfb483ce">I took AP Stat in high school, and the content in this course is very similar to that minus the R portion. The R part of this class is also not terrible, especially if you have background programming from other courses. <br/><br/>With Mark and James, this course has biweekly PSets. This was incredibly helpful, and the PSets themselves were very doable, especially if you went to Office Hours. However, I could not get behind either Mark or James&#x27;s lecture style. Every lecture, I was extremely disengaged  and bored. Mark and James are both great at answering questions and explaining content when it comes down to it, but I feel like they both go fairly slow and they don&#x27;t generate much enthusiasm, making it difficult to learn. I felt like I ended up learning the most when I reviewed content on my own time&#x2F;when I watched lecture on my own time, which was a bit annoying since I wanted to go to lecture so I wouldn&#x27;t have to go later, but I would not retain any material after sitting in lecture.<br/><br/>I think this is a fine course, and if you put in the work, you will definitely succeed and not have any problems. I would maybe consider other similar courses to fulfill whatever requirement that you are trying to use Stat 100 to fulfill though, like PSY1900 or Gov 50 if possible.</td>

			<td class="TabularBody_LeftColumn" headers="comment-2_bfc5a2cd-2dbe-457f-8c8e-805bcfb483ce">This course convinced me that statistics is an avenue I would be happy learning more about. That being said, this class definitely needs to refocus in order to deliver a completely rewarding experience for its students. Sometimes I felt lost in a numerical maze: there would be dense (and long) formulas on the screen which were sped past with very little English explanation. This definitely detracted from my experience, because it was easy to get lost in the concepts the professor would bring up. Learning R (as someone who can code) was already an understated challenge, and I feel like between the problem sets expectations and the code briefly covered in class, I struggled a lot with being able to complete the problem sets in R. Exams gave me an undue amount of anxiety because it quickly became apparent that anything could be on the midterm and final, and the practice exams did not do much to assuage my fears. Without taking AP Statistics, I&#x27;m pretty sure I would be defeated by this class.<br/><br/>That is not saying you shouldn&#x27;t try the class, however. Just be sure to pay attention in class and ask questions (the professors are very receptive to questions) and make the most out of section. It was one of my more overwhelming classes (as someone who likes to know what is going on), but it is possible for you to scrap together a decent grade. The course material isn&#x27;t too challenging, but it can become conclusion if you don&#x27;t take an active approach.</td>

Lectures felt taught off the slides, sections weren&#x27;t the most helpful, and the homework was every two weeks, which felt disjointed. My biggest issue is about the midterm and final. I felt like there was discord between the paper and coding portions of Stat100 as a whole, almost like they couldn&#x27;t choose which to go with, which exacerbated itself in the midterm and final, where the questions didn&#x27;t match a lot of the material we learned about.</td>

Their lectures could be clearer, but they did a pretty decent job. However, the rest of the class was pretty bad and disorganized. The office hours were often cancelled or screwed up. I would avoid this class within reason, but it wasn&#x27;t horrible.</td>
